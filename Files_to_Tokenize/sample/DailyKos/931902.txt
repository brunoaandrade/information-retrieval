	<text>  A while back I got one of my climate letters printed in the Jakarta Times. &nbsp;So far, that's the most distant place I've seen print. A few days ago, my letter got picked up by a Colorado Conservablogger. This is a good one, friends. &nbsp;He calls my letter (ta-dah!):  "The Very Definition of America-Hating Liberal Guilt"      To refresh your memory, I wrote:  As a US citizen, I must accept responsibility for my own nation&rsquo;s abject failure to take responsibility for its actions. As the world&rsquo;s largest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases and as the enabler of a consumerist lifestyle which, if left unchecked, is absolutely certain to submerge the planet in giga tons of toxic trash, the United States has been the driving force behind the climate crisis. Unfortunately, my country&rsquo;s responsibilities are unlikely to be met any time soon, for we are in the grip of a political crisis brought about by a national exaltation of demagoguery and ignorance. Thus our governing bodies are riddled with arrogant men and women who dismiss scientific expertise as irrelevant, preferring the comforts of ancient superstition. Global warming&rsquo;s realities are terrifying. But as citizens of ocean states can attest, ignoring those facts will surely lead to outcomes beside which our nightmares will pale into insignificance. Warren Senders Medford, Massachusetts   And here's Colorado Right's response, with my interpolations:  So we start off with a line that could be lifted from just about any Barack Oprompter speech outside the US apologizing for their country.   Whereas Conservatives know that taking responsibility, either for your own actions or those of your country, is totally wimpy and self-hating! &nbsp;America doesn't have to take responsibility for what it does, because WE'Z NUMBAR WUN! Indeed. &nbsp;We're Number One in the production of trash, for one thing, which is another way of saying America is tops in the world at subtracting value from things (that's what trash is, right? &nbsp;Stuff from which value has been removed.). Anyway, USA ROOLZ, just because we can. Next:  Breast beating about how we use lots of energy since we manufacture and consume so much that our economy is still 20% of global world output. &nbsp;In other words &#8211; we generate more economic activity and energy in 2 days than the entire country of Indonesia does in a year. &nbsp;Yeah, that&rsquo;s something to be really sorry about.   And how much of that manufacturing and consumption is for stuff that, y'know, actually adds value to the world? &nbsp;Just because you pay money for the gas you burn while your Hummer idles outside the coffeeshop doesn't make it an actual contribution of anything except greenhouse gases. And the point I was making is of course that if we're the ones generating all the pollution, we should be the ones taking responsibility for cleaning it up. &nbsp;And, furthermore, if a country like Indonesia, with a carbon footprint that's less than a rounding error, finds its actual existence imperiled because of rising sea levels (triggered by climate change brought about by greenhouse emissions), then we have a moral responsibility to address the problem, rather than just shouting "USA ROOLZ!!" Which loops me back to the issue of responsibility, addressed above.   Islamic foreigners think the US is Satan anyway &#8211; so knocking your own country as "a national exaltation of demagoguery and ignorance" and "riddled with arrogant men and women who dismiss scientific expertise as irrelevant" will make them feel so good about you. &nbsp;Of course you little knock about ancient superstition &#8211; does that include say Islamic beliefs about having 4 wives and marrying off your 9 year old girls?   When faced with irrefutable facts, what do you do? YIKES SKAREEE MOOOOOOSLIMS!!!!! &nbsp;ZOMG!!!! OH NOEZ!!!! Mind you, I hold all the Abrahamic sects in more or less equal regard. &nbsp; Here's a conditional for you: If America's founders had been Islamic schismatics in search of a new place to carry on their particular version of their particular version of the tribal creed, and their descendants had written a secular Constitution with a First Amendment just like our own back in the late 1700's...and modern America was filled with fundamentalist Islamic historical revisionists who were trying to argue that "America has always been a fundamentally Judeo-Mohammedan nation"...and they were denying climate science in the bargain &mdash; why, I'd have written exactly the same letter.  And here&rsquo;s the one sure thing Warren &#8211; when Islam takes over America you will be one of the first ones up against the wall. &nbsp;Regardless of how much you grovel from your centrally heated and air conditioned, 24 hour per day electrically provisioned, suburban house that any Indonesian would chew off their arm to live in.   When Islam takes over America? &nbsp;What on Earth are you smoking? I swear, Conservative Islamophobes are the biggest bunch of bedwetters I've ever seen. On the other hand, when Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh are submerged or rendered uninhabitable by rising ocean levels, there will be millions of climate refugees, all extremely pissed off at the industrialized West for very good reason. &nbsp;Where will they go? &nbsp;YIKES OMG!!! Therefore, the best way to avoid an Islamic takeover of America is to fight global warming. &nbsp;Q.E.D. The ball's in your court, Spiro.    This piece is crossposted at Running Gamak.   </text>

	<title>Therefore, the best way to avoid</title>
	<date>Mon Dec 27, 2010 at 03:56:47 PM PST</date>
	<author>Edger</author>
	<text>Therefore, the best way to avoid an Islamic takeover of America is to fight global warming? "Spiro" might want to think again about that, if he can think even once. .......... On May 16, 2009 a collaboration between the British medical journal The Lancet and University College London released the first UCL Lancet Commission report, assessing the impact of global warming on global health, and on populations. Titled Managing the health effects of climate change (.PDF), the year long study highlights the threat of climate change on patterns of disease, water and food insecurity, human settlements, extreme climatic events, and population migration. The report also highlights the action required by global society to mitigate the health impacts of climate change. "Climate change," the report concludes, "is the biggest global health threat of the 21 century." But the impact on and cost to human societies globally is hugely unequal, with the populations of developed countries that benefit most from fossil fuels projected to suffer the least, while poorer countries that because of the projected health cost to their peoples have the maximum incentive to prevent climate change have virtually no power to do anything to prevent the changes. It's the old story of the comparatively few rich benefiting in comfort at the expense of poverty stricken multitudes. The report presents the two distorted maps shown below (click the images to view full size) - density equalizing cartograms depicting a comparison of undepleted CO2 emissions by country for 1950-2000 versus the regional distribution of four climate sensitive health consequences (malaria, malnutrition, diarrhea, and inland flood-related fatalities).    view full size image    The first map shows the world in terms of carbon emissions. America, for instance, is huge. So is China. And Europe. Africa is hardly visible. The second map shows the world in terms of increased mortality -- that is to say, deaths -- from climate change. Suddenly, America virtually disappears. So does Europe. Africa, however, is grotesquely distended. South Asia inflates. In Barack Obama's commencement address Sunday May 17, 2009 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Obama exhorted the graduates to recognize that "that our fates are tied up, as Dr. King said, in a 'single garment of destiny.'" and "Your generation must decide how to save God's creation from a changing climate that threatens to destroy it." But the peoples of the world are not bound equally. "Loss of healthy life years as a result of global environmental change (including climate change) is predicted to be 500 times greater in poor African [and Asian] populations than in European populations," states the UCL Lancet Commission report bluntly. .......... Three guesses where they are going to want to go... "Spiro" is upside down and backwards, as usual...</text>

	<text>Easily pictured... NCAR Predicts Extreme Drought In Next Decades  The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has released a new study combining 22 climate models. These models are not looking at global warming, but rather the chance of increased drought world wide as temperatures climb. (Just a quick aside, you see real scientists aren&rsquo;t falling for the "debate" meme that climate change deniers push. They know what is going on and have moved on to what will happen) ... ...projections expect much of the United States to be in a state of chronic severe drought between 2030 and 2039. The further out one goes the worse these projections get, but given the problem with predicting change over many decades even the NCAR Rep says that we should take those with a grain of salt. Still, if we confine ourselves the prediction for just the next thirty years it bodes for a lot of trouble. The bread basket of the United State is the mid-west. Once you get passed the Mississippi and before you get to the Rockies is some of our biggest agricultural lands. If this prediction is accurate, by the 2030&rsquo;s this area will be constantly in a state drought. The days of pouring water and fertilizer on the soil of the heart land may very well be over. If there is no water, there is no crops.   pictures here...</text>
