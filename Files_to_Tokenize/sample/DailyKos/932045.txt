	<text>  In 1957, Frank Kameny, an astronomer for the government, was fired from his job because he was gay. This was an enormous mistake on the government's part, as Kameny immediately took on the government's policies of purging gays from government jobs and the military. He said, "My dismissal amounted to a declaration of war against me by the government,"... "and I tend not to lose my wars." By 1961, he had attempted and failed at the more sensible and legal remedies to his situation. He'd even filed the first gay rights brief at the Supreme Court - a petition for certiorari (pdf) that was ultimately rejected. The language in the petition would make today's gay rights groups blush:    "Petition asserts, flatly, unequivocally, and absolutely uncompromisingly that homosexuality, whether by mere inclination or overt act, is not only not immoral but that, for those choosing voluntarily to engage in homosexual acts, such acts are moral in a real and positive sense, and are good, right, and desirable, socially and personally." [...] "Respondent's case is rotten to the core. Respondent's case has been shown to fail factually and to be defective procedurally ... The entire bases for respondents actions in this and in similar cases have been shown to be arbitrary, capricious and without reasonable foundation ... The govenrment's entire set of polciies and practices in this field is bankrupt, and needs a searching re-assessment and re-evaluation ..."   These arguments were, of course, proven correct in study after study, starting in 1957 and leading into today. The government never actually had any reason to ban gay people from either government jobs or the military. It was done out of plain dislike for gay people. Its effects still reverberate and they'll continue on until the government rids itself of its institutionally discriminatory policies. The climate in which Kameny pursued a remedy for his dismissal, and the climate in which he pursued his activism was a pretty terrifying time for gays:   McCarthyism is the term applied to the attempts in the late 1940s and early 1950s to expunge Communists and fellow travelers (often identified as homosexual) from American public life. Named for Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the term has come to signify Red-baiting, political extremism, and civic hysteria. For gay men and lesbians, the period was one of police harassment, witch hunts, suspicions of disloyalty, and dismissals from jobs, especially in the public sector. Indeed, McCarthyism may be seen as the time when homosexuals became the chief scapegoats of the Cold War. In the United States and Great Britain, throughout the 1950s, thousands of individuals were arrested and imprisoned on homosexual charges. The popular consensus that homosexuals were immoral, emotionally unstable, and untrustworthy justified their punishment and stigmatization. [...] Republican Senator Kenneth Wherry of Nebraska summarized these popular perceptions in an interview with the New York Post in December 1950: "You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives. . . . Mind you, I don't say that every homosexual is a subversive, and I don't say every subversive is a homosexual. But [people] of low morality are a menace in the government, whatever [they are], and they are all tied up together."   This oppressive behavior by the government only made the gay rights movement more desperate for acceptance and more willing to stand up and fight. Like anyone who is oppressed, gays during that time were strong and determined to make it through that rough period. Despite government and religious and societal persecution, people do what they need to do to survive. And people find support if it is out there.  But the harassment of homosexuals throughout the 1950s also led them to believe in the necessity of mutual support. Although fighting back was not always possible and many gay men and lesbians were affected by guilt and internalized the stereotypes of the era, the 1950s was also the beginning of activism in the lesbian and gay communities.   During this time, the gay rights movement was called the homophile movement, and it was not very successful. Their strategy was to say, basically, "We're just sick! We aren't criminals! There's just something wrong with us!" Kameny was having none of that:   Kameny felt that such an approach was counterproductive, and that rather than begging for crumbs, gay people should demand equality with heterosexuals. To gain equality, he argued, the movement should renounce the sickness theory and embrace militant tactics.   He got the gay rights movement to talk to politicians, lead marches and protests, and he got them to start saying, loudly, that "Gay is Good" and that it is equal to heterosexuality. He organized some of the first protests at the Pentagon and the White House for gay rights. And he wrote letters to President Johnson:   October 23, 1965 Dear Mr. President: A group of homosexual American citizens, and those supporting their cause, is picketing the White House, today, in lawful, dignified, and orderly protest - in the best American tradition - against the treatment being meted out to fifteen million homosexual American citizens by their government - treatment which consistently makes of them second-class citizens, at best.   The letters go on to discuss both the dismissal of gay employees from government jobs and the firing of gays from the military.  In April 1965, the group organized the first gay demonstration at the White House. A dozen or so gay men and lesbians, including Kameny and Barbara Gittings, dressed in business attire, carried signs reading "First Class Treatment for Homosexuals" and "Civil Service Commission is Un-American." A few months after that demonstration, the U. S. Court of Appeals issued a ground-breaking decision. The court held that rejection of an application for federal employment on the grounds of "homosexual conduct" was "too vague." The Civil Service Commission, the court ruled, failed to state "why [homosexuality] related to occupational competence or fitness."   It took ten more years to end that particular ban, but it would not have happened without Kameny's involvement, in the protests and in court actions, and the strength of gay activists and their supporters. It takes constant fighting to win these battles. It takes stubbornness and unwillingness to ever back down. Kameny and the rest of our predecessors in the gay rights movement fought the military's gay ban and did not succeed until now. The US government finally apologized for firing Kameny in 2009. We have a long way to go before we can gain employment discrimination protections or marriage, but we wouldn't be where we are without our fighters in the gay rights movement. This relentless, decades long fight has resulted in few victories, but we will not give up. We will keep being stubborn, impatient and we'll continue to be unwilling to back down from this fight as long as there's opposition to recognizing our humanity. We won't lose this war, I can promise you that. </text>

	<text>I know what you mean, I was never so shocked as when I saw an upright and breathing Spiro Agnew at Nixon's funeral (not that his disinterred corpse wouldn't have caused me to raise an eyebrow as well). I think it was due to my having heard years before that he was suffering from cancer, and I had simply extrapolated his demise. Anyhow, it was the only time in my life I can recall having literally had one of those cliched "Am I awake or dreaming this?" moments.</text>

But it's not just equality that they despise: it's liberty itself. &nbsp; Think about it. &nbsp;In every possible issue, these people go against the individual making choices for him/her self and for the government making that choice for them: abortion - does a woman have a right to decide what to do with her body? no. death with dignity - does a dying person have a right to decide when to die? no. gay marriage - does a person have the right to determine whom to marry? no. medical marijuana - does a person have the right to ease his suffering? no. the death penalty - does a person have the right to live out his days? no. &nbsp;in fact, the more people who can be imprisoned and placed directly under the control of the government, the better. &nbsp;because, in the end, liberty is bad, and government control is good. the war - see the death penalty, but bigger. film ratings - ah, well, sex is bad, because people are happy and doing what they please; whereas, violence is good, because the individual has little power, and torture is even better because the individual is reduced to a blob to be played with. These are very sick people. &nbsp;And they have power. &nbsp;And that bodes well for exactly no.body.</text>

	<text>I would also like to mention an old fried, Otis Tabler. He was doing classified computer work as a civilian when a new general had Otis' security clearance lifted. Otis sued and won the case to get his clearance back. His basic position was that everyone knew he was gay and therefore he could not be blackmailed. This was in the '70s. Otis and I were office mates at NASA in the early-mid '60s. He was totally out then. He was always true to himself which meant he was incredibly brave for the times. He is gone now but not forgotten.</text>

And I hope that progress will be made to eliminate inequities, and if I, by some twist of fate, were called to take a stand or make a statement, it would be for the arc of justice and freedom and help to bend it in the correct direction.</text>

	<text>On the flip side... If they needed you, they would go to great lengths to look the other way. This is why it was shocking to me that they booted out so many Arab linguists. I'd love to know how the career of the Commander responsible for that turned out. There have been far less valuable queers protected and/or ignored in the past. One classic example--the late Perry Watkins told them he was gay when he was inducted during Vietnam. After numerous reenlistments, they finally decided to be shocked that he was gay. This was after he had staged variety shows (including drag) and did his officer's wives' hair. I remember Pat Buchanan's outrage in 1993 over DADT when he lamented "they're trying to destroy the last true meritocracy in America". The truth is that if you're the fair-haired boy, you can literally get away with murder in the military.</text>

	<text>Yep. If you were arrested for "homosexual conduct", in the military or out, very few attempts were made to keep name out of the news. I remember seeing a "public health" short on YouTube from that era, about homosexual adults and teenagers...a cautionary tale. I wasn't so surprised at the general attitude toward the gay men (I was familiar with the history at that point), but what got me was that the teenagers (and these were 13-14 year olds, not 17-18) were convicted for homosexual conduct as well! I don't know if it was just the contrast from this era where any adult sexual contact with anyone under 18 for any reason at any spot in the country is an unholy violation of sacred childhood or if that really was a sign of just how much homosexuality was hated at the time.</text>

	<text>It was an extremely paranoid society but also one that had been profoundly changed by the social upheaval that accompanied World War II. &nbsp;That war created physical, social and cultural mobility on a scale never seen before. &nbsp;It's quite possible that many of the lesbians and gay men of that time might never have even conceived of their own sexuality as part of their identity, had they not met each other, far from home, serving in the armed forces or on the home front. &nbsp; But that same war also created a fixation on evil, with all its dark undertones.</text>

	<text>Did you see the prices for those books? $80 for a new paperback, $25 for a used one. Hardcover versions a bit higher than that. This indicates to me that the book is not widely available, which is very sad. I bought it and read it when it was first published.</text>

	<text>One of my first diaries was about Turing It's here: A Tragic Ending to a Brilliant Life (The Gay Man Who Invented Computers). (Forgive me for the style of the diary -- I was new here and had figured out blockquotes but didn't know about links.) Turing was a fascinating man. I'd highly recommend the Hodges book.</text>

	<title>The 1950s-era one</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 04:39:50 PM PST</date>
	<author>musing85</author>
	<text>The 1950s-era one in the Fellows of the Royal Society series isn't worth much, since most of Turing's wartime work was still covered under the Official Secrets Act. Time did a brief profile in 1999 (?) when he was picked as one of their 100 most influential people of the 20th century. Andrew Hodges's 1983 biography, Alan Turing: The Enigma is probably the broadest-reaching book. David Leavitt recently came out (2007) with a new book, but it seems mostly about his work as the founder of computer science (I haven't read it, so I can only go by the title: The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer; for what it's worth, the two reviews at Barnes &amp; Noble are both not complimentary.). Jim Corrigan (also in 2007) came out with something for the Profiles in Mathematics series, which I also haven't read. Those are the only ones I'm aware of.</text>

	<text>I agreed with Get Equal and Lt. Choi. My only concern was that I was increasingly worried about him being out on the edge. AFAIC, this Congress produced the bare minimum for LGBT rights--one major bill (DADT) and one minor bill (hate crimes). My position is that if we haven't cleared the table by 2020, we should start shutting down some cities. I'm ready to amend that to advocate that if we don't get one major bill passed in every Congress we should do so. Now that we have a GOP House, I'm ready to step it up.</text>

	<author>HoundDog</author>
	<text>It's time now to focus on passing ENDA, repealing DOMA, and getting full equality with regard to marraige in all states. If President Obama, and other Democratic leaders would renounce their "civil unions only" positions and support the idea of full equality for all Americans, it would be greatly helpful and appreciated. To try to argue that anyone familiar with our Constitution, and 14th amendment would, in these modern times, &nbsp;support only the "separate but equal" civil unions only, position is discouraging and sad. It is certainly the opposite of the "fierce urgency of now" attitude established by Martin Luther King, Jr. &nbsp; Would he roll over in his grave to see his fundemental agressive and morality based modus operandi, appropriated as a campaign slogun? Or would he wonder if we've degenerated to the "fierce hypocracy of political expediency?" If our Party leaders choose to pick up the banner of being a "fierce advocate" for this part of our 2008 winning coalition it could go a really long way in firing us back up for the 2012 elections. &nbsp;With big multiplier effects for other parts of our progressive coaltion. &nbsp; And it's entirely symbollic. &nbsp;We don't need any approval from the GOP, or House Republicans to march out to the Rose Garden tomorrow and annouce an upgrade to moral support for full equality for all Americans, even though we will be battling this out in the states and courts for a decade to come, in all likihood. &nbsp; The majority of the population is with us now.</text>

If even a Democratic administration is going to keep opposing marriage, how does anyone think that might make those people who have just started to come around feel? They might back off support because even mainstream Democrats refuse to do so.</text>

	<text>A Few Years Ago My Aunt Moved Back Home to the small rural town my parents live in. She has been with her partner for more then 30 years. She wanted to go with my parents to their church. When I say my family built the church I mean literally my family built it. They sunned her. It took my parents like ten seconds to let that church know they suck! &nbsp;I think there was actually a time where my dad might have said actually said, "you fucking suck." I think I mentioned in another comment my folks are Republicans. But they are sane. Not treating my aunt with respect, well a line too far for them.</text>

	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 04:31:08 PM PST</date>
	<author>raincrow</author>
	<text>Sauce for the goose... While nudity is widely depicted in European advertising, based only on my anecdotal experience, most of the nudes are women and a significant percentage of them are spread-eagled or otherwise offered up as (IMO) so much meat and nobody bats an eye. By contrast, ads depicting men spread-eagled and flagrantly showing dat bone generate controversy. To me, this bespeaks a tacit inequality. I also remember, thru the 60s, Europeans tut-tutting about our uptight, puritanical sexual mores. Then came our so-called sexual revolution, and by the late 70s I was hearing Europeans hold forth on the indiscriminate and voracious sexual appetites of Americans!  * * * And it's tangential, but while I'm at it, might as well note that sexism in Europe is depressingly alive and rampant. Swiss women didn't win suffrage until 1971 (and still were illegally denied the vote in some rural areas until ~1990), and the women of Lichtenstein couldn't vote until '84. Fewer women per capita are in corporate management in Europe than in the U.S. Sexual stereotypes and lack of child care are still significant barriers to women's economic success in much of Europe. France ranks 80th or a bit lower in the number of women in ministerial posts. Only ~12% of the Greek parliament is female. 45% of European women have been the victim of physical violence, half of them as adults. Sexual harassment/violence in the workplace and public harassment are still far more widely condoned than in the U.S. The lot of women, particularly rural women, in countries such as Greece, Portugal, Italy, and the Balkan countries is disgraceful. Sex-based pay inequality is as significant a problem in Europe as here, and Europe trails the U.S. in the % of women-owned businesses. In addition, homophobia and anti-LGBT violence are still a VERY significant problem across the Pond, especially in Eastern Europe.</text>

Hay was a CPUSA veteran and the original group was set up very much along the lines of the party (even though the Communist Party no more approved of homosexuality than anyone else did back then). Sadly, once the Mattachine Society was well established, the newer members essentially changed the organization and focus, for example by requiring a loyalty oath to the US, and did their best to bury its origins and its founding members.</text>

	<text>An interesting twist to the history of gay rights is that Kameny and the Mattachine Society were arguing that homosexuals are not deviants or perverts, they're ordinary and productive citizens. However, this led them to shun people with Communist associations. They also tended to dislike transvestites and transgenders, because they didn't follow the prevailing norms (some people call this "homonormativity," which means valuing people who follow the hetero norms).</text>

	<text>There is certainly a tension there If you look at photos of some of the early gay rights demos in DC (ones Kameny had a strong hand in organizing), everyone is dressed very conservatively. Of course that's the way it is in DC to some extent anyway but still the intent was to make everyone look as "ordinary" and "respectable" as possible. While we need all aspects of the movement, from the most conventional to most extraordinary, reconciling things all the way and getting people who have various kinds of axe to grind can be a challenge.</text>

That tells me a lot about their courage and their conviction; that they were right, and that they believed that history would agree with them. Awesome.

Though I did not know him well, whenever I said hello to him he would always be more than happy to return the greeting. He did things in the 1950s and 1960s that most would never have dared to try. Following the loss of his federal government job he helped found the DC chapter of the Mattachine Society and of what was known, when I lived in DC, as Gay Activists Alliance of DC. &nbsp;He also helped found the National Lesbian and Gay Task Force (back when "lesbian" was merely assumed under the word "gay") as well as Gay Rights National Lobby, which eventually became HRC. How he feels about the latter I'm not entirely sure.</text>

	<title>That's a structural problem</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 05:59:07 AM PST</date>
	<author>jayjaybear</author>
	<text>That's a structural problem   for the gay community. If you grow up American, you're taught about people like Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln all throughout your life. If you grow up black, you're taught about people like MLK, or Malcolm X, or Harriet Tubman all throughout your life. If you grow up Christian, you're taught about Jesus, God, and Mary all throughout your life. But, until VERY recently, no one grew up gay in that same way. Even today, most LGB people don't really learn any gay history until they're adults and have actually plugged into a gay community of some sort. A large part of this is a lingering (but still very real) fear of being a gay adult having any interaction at all with gay youth. That cripples our ability to create any kind of natural community values/lore mechanism that allows gay kids to feel the same kind of community pride and belonging that "natural" ethnic/religion/geographic communities can inculcate. The end result, though, is that gay cultural touchstones and icons tend to be internalized at a certain remove, as opposed to the cultural touchstones and icons we internalized through cultural osmosis as children.   </text>

	<title>Still bewilders me that decades after the US</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 05:35:54 PM PST</date>
	<author>snafubar</author>
	<text>Still bewilders me that decades after the US has declared that it's unacceptable to judge a person on their skin color and their gender that we still have so many people in society - with the current backing of the law - who get to decide who's "acceptable" for the rights they themselves enjoy and who's not. DOMA must someday be declared unconstitutional, or we've got to seriously question how the 13th and 19th Amendment still stand; or how Loving v Virginia isn't precedent for allowing gay MARRIAGE (not merely 'seperate but equal' civil unions). Whenever I think of it in this spirit, it makes me ponder why Brown V. Board of Ed hasn't been the first launching pad for a right to marry. It's surreal to me that the RW/Conservative Christian voices all cry about how important marriage is to a person's individual liberty, yet they have somehow not conceded that then it must also be the most essential "pursuit of happiness" there ever could be. Yet, in this country it's still subject to popular vote and prejudice. I'm a little bewildered nobody has been able to take this angle and run successfully with it yet - until I admit to myself that even in The Greatest Country In The World (TM), some people still have to have a bogey. Ok. Sorry if I used your comment to build my soap box.</text>

	<text>Great Diary! I love stuff like this, indie! Keep it up. He really was right on the money in terms of arguing that gay is good. GLBT is Awesome! w00t!!! And you are awesome as well, you fabulous gay activist and writer. This is going on my fridge!   This relentless, decades long fight has resulted in few victories, but we will not give up. We will keep being stubborn, impatient and we'll continue to be unwilling to back down from this fight as long as there's opposition to recognizing our humanity. We won't lose this war, I can promise you that.  </text>

	<title>McCarthyism is alive in the US Congress</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 06:58:47 PM PST</date>
	<author>cocinero</author>
	<text>McCarthyism is alive in the US Congress  McCarthyism is the term applied to the attempts in the late 1940s and early 1950s to expunge Communists and fellow travelers (often identified as homosexual) from American public life. Named for Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the term has come to signify Red-baiting, political extremism, and civic hysteria.   Andrew Breitbart's web site includes the following from an interview with Steve King (IA-05):  RSN: Cliff Kincaid recently had a National Press Club conference where he called for resurrection of the Congressional internal security committees along the lines of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Would you support recreation of such committees? King: I would. Something similar. If we called it the House Un-American Activities Committee, that would be lighting up the history of McCarthy in a way that wouldn&#8217;t be necessary, although I am often quoted as saying &#8220;McCarthy was a hero for America&#8221;. He was. He was right far more times than he was wrong. It is a historical fact. But I would submit a different committee name so that we don&#8217;t have to deal with the history, and move forward. I think that is a good process and I would support it.   King called ENDA "legalized entrapment." Of course King opposed repeal of DADT. He called that and other things passed during the lame duck session "another pie in the face of the American people."</text>

	<text>One of the many wonderful things about the   extended marriage fight in California is that it brought back into the spotlight two of the grandes dames of LGB rights, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, who actually founded the Daughters of Bilitis back in 1955. One of the great and happy coincidences of history is that they got to be recognized by their state as spouses while they still could be.   </text>

	<text>Sadly, not for very long Del Martin died of complications from a fractured arm in August 2008, just two and a half months after they were finally able to get married, after 56 years as a couple.</text>

	<text>Oh, I know..the important thing is that they DID get to do so before either of them passed, and that the state of California legally recognized Phyllis as Del's widow (at the time...I haven't followed this legally. Did she lose that recognition after Prop 8 or did their status as one of the pre-existing ssm's save it?)</text>

	<text>Good. If a valid marriage isn't made by almost 60 years of sharing their life and their love, I don't know what WOULD make a valid marriage.</text>

	<title>One quibble with your account</title>

	<text>One quibble with your account is that you refer to a gay rights movement in the 1950s. &nbsp;I heard Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine Society, explain this in an interview some years ago, when the interviewer asked about the eary days of the movement. &nbsp;The gay rights movement in those days, such as it was, was Frank Kameny, full stop. &nbsp;There really was no one else who was willing to even admit publicly to being homosexual. &nbsp;Doing so would ruin their lives and their livelihood, just as the Kameny found out when he was fired. &nbsp;What societies that existed in those days (the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Belitis) were mostly social organizations offering emotional support to members. &nbsp;At best, any thoughts of political goals were protean. It was a very different, almost unrecognizable world from the one that exists today, from the point of view of acceptance of LGBT people in society. &nbsp;We have Frank Kameny, Barbara Gittings, and all the other early pioneers to thank for taking those first bold steps.</text>
