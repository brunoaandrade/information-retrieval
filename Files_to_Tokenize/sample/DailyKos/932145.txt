	<text>That's JaxDem. I knew that it would be controversial, but we have to be part of the reality-based community. Last summer, folks like Sarah Palin gave wonderful rants about "death panels" that the right-wing base just loved. Unfortunately, they were not based on facts. We ought to try to do better.</text>

In his thirty-year career, Danson has been nominated for fourteen Primetime Emmy Awards, winning two; ten Golden Globe Awards nominations, winning three; one Screen Actors Guild Awards nomination; one American Comedy Award and a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. He was ranked second in TV Guide's list of the top 25 television stars. Mary Tyler Moore (born December 29, 1936) is an American actress, primarily known for her roles in television sitcoms. Moore is best known for The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970&#8211;1977), in which she starred as Mary Richards, a 30-something single woman who worked as a local news producer in Minneapolis, and for her earlier role as Laura Petrie (Dick Van Dyke's wife) on The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961&#8211;1966). She also appeared in a number of films, most notably 1980's Ordinary People, in which she played a role that was the polar opposite of the television characters she had portrayed, and for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Moore has also been active in charity work and various political causes, particularly on behalf of Animal rights and Diabetes mellitus type 1.  </text>

	<text>Morning Stats Heads! While the East Coast is digging out we are still waiting for the first major snow of the year in the Mile High. They say we'll get five inches tomorrow, but for today it is another 50 degree day. (Note, the mountains have been pounded, but the plains have had just over an inch this winter, very, very, very dry)</text>

	<text>r u sitting down? swallow. take all drinks away   From screens, keyboards, and devices. Brace. --just out of idol curiosity I went 2 c what beloved JanF was doing, or where she was doing it. And - I clicked her comments to find out. And - A multiple account message appeared as she copied it into MM's recent comment thread from Sat. And - Yikes! I never thought about those consequences re cite ruelz. But somebody noticed it and reacted with a formal request admonishment for aacknowledgement. So Guess she'll b back when the rools allow And - I hope it's near instantaneous as kossible. ---- I, too had unsticked recs problems earlier and it took me 3 tries to uprate a mistaken HR (Wader, sorry,) and this is the old fone back configured I hope correctly bcaws the new lemon froze dead and needs a visit to the TMobile Hospital. And I have no Email ability until then. And, that's it. And that.  (I hope sum1 answered navajo...) Ciao.    </text>
