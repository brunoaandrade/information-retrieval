	<title>My diary was a ball of confusion</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 07:14:32 AM PST</date>
	<author>Eddie C</author>
	<text>My diary was a ball of confusion I watched the PBS NewsHour as always and got so angry but I have sworn off politics for the holidays. Then I realized I was so angry when Joan McCarter posted "Foreclosure Nation" and one more foreclosure fraud horror story. If there is anyone here that I can read fully it is Joan but I was so mad that I could not finish the piece. So I posted a very short diary on the report and Deep South Doug informed me that it was actually a report from April 12th. It was old news but how much has changed. &nbsp; Still in all as I confused myself in anger I may have confused others with a diary that had a short stay on the rec list. Sorry, I'll pay better attention next time.</text>

	<author>smileycreek</author>
	<text>You mean as in having a special tag? No, I don't think so. As I understand it, Series refer to diaries that are published on a regular schedule without fail (Frankenoid's Saturday Morning Garden blogging comes to mind). &nbsp;It's a recognition of how hard it is to consistently run a regular series. Mini-series are not regularly scheduled but do consistently address a specific issue, one that is perhaps limited in duration. &nbsp;I don't have time to look up the mini-series noms but I think Fishgrease is in there for the Booming series he did during the gulf oil spill. Clear as mud?</text>
