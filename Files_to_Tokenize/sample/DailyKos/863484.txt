	<text>  A couple of years ago, under my old AAF handle I did a good news diary: Being a Futurama fan, I've always wanted to say this but could not find the propitious moment. Writing about water scarcity &amp; food shortages is taxing and angers me at times particularly when I come across disheartening news caused by blatant greed and callous disregard for our planet.  Well, I wanted to do another one. I searched and searched for some good news on water and became depressed. The water news are grim. Let me show you in a few sentences from around the world how dire the situation is: Fresh water supplies are going to run out, so what can we do to make the taps keep running? A fellow environmentalist, Brian Fagan, asked this question and wrote a book, a must read book titled A HUMAN HISTORY OF WATER (Bloomsbury) A billion of us currently go hungry because there is not enough water to grow food. Much of the world's water is still unpriced, but it is now the most valuable commodity in the world. To compound the problem, 60 per cent of the world's people live in crowded river basins shared by several countries, often with daggers drawn     Water use in China and the Middle East is an environmental Ponzi scheme writes Damian Carrington from the Guardian. He drives the point home with these facts: Find water and you find life. This simple maxim guides scientists searching distant planets for aliens. But if the astrobiologists were to reverse their telescopes and look at our own globe, they would find a conundrum: billions of people living in places with little or no water. That unsustainable paradox is now unravelling before our eyes in the Middle East and north Africa. The 16 most water-stressed states on Earth are all in that troubled region, with Bahrain at the top of the ranking from risk analysts Maplecroft. Libya, Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia and Syria follow not far behind. All are built on an environmental Ponzi scheme, using more water than they receive: 700 times more in Libya's case. The unrest of the Arab spring of course has many causes, but arguably the most fundamental is the crumbling of a social contract that offered cheap water – and hence food – in return for subservience to dictators.  Water shortages threaten renewable energy production, experts warn. Indeed. Reading this report from Suzanne Goldenberg is even more depressing. The development of new renewable energy technologies and other expanding sources of energy such as shale gas will be limited by the availability of water in some regions of the world, according to research by a US thinktank. The study shows the reliance on large amounts of water to create biofuels and run solar thermal energy and hydraulic fracturing – a technique for extracting gas from unconventional geological formations underground – means droughts could hamper their deployment. "Water consumption is going up dramatically. We are introducing all kinds of technology to reduce the carbon impact of energy, without doing anything to reduce its impact on water," Michele Wucker, co-author of the report, told a seminar at the New America Foundation, a thinktank in Washington.  A poster remarked in one of my water diary that France was sitting pretty, with 0ver 85% of its energy coming from its plethora of nuclear reactors. Sure, that is true. But water plays a major role in cooling off those reactors, doncha know? I almost missed this report - the French don't publish much on the state of their reactors: Water Shortages Threatening France's Nuclear Reactor Complex: The 11 March 9.0 Richter scale earthquake that rattled Japan saw its shoreline structures survive, but the 50-foot waves generated by tsunami that followed less than an hour later destroyed many Japanese coastal installations and knocked out power to Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) six nuclear reactor complex at Fukushima, instigating a crisis that has yet to be resolved. Now, half a world away, a shortage of water is threatening France’s nuclear reactor complex, as the region’s worst drought in more than a half-century drains rivers and free-flowing water to cooling reactors. Most French rivers have seen a significant drop in their water levels because the drought has affected half of the country's counties, which farming unions maintain is the worst in 35 years.  Another writer I read is Dr Alison Bailey, who runs the Department of Agriculture, University of Reading. She writes: With less than 20% of normal rainfall falling over large parts of England during March and April arable farmers, particularly in the southern and eastern regions of England, are facing serious problems. Yield losses and increased disease pressure are going to be inevitable.  Water shortages – CropWorld Global 2011 to consider the implications The only sliver lining I see about Climate Change is that it has triggered a universal wake-up call that we all hear, and some, though still too few, are beginning to heed. The usual suspects, the skeptics, are driven by greed and graft taken from the multinationals, and by idiots like Murdoch whose special-interest-press publishes rubbish and false stories, relentlessly, about environmentalists. What the world needs now is a huge dose of human ingenuity and human creativity. I have great faith in humanity and this diary is dedicated to those out there bursting their synapses coming up with novel ways of making the world less dependent on fossil fuels, working out solutions to feed the planet and generally trying to make this earth a better place; if you look at the human brain from say, 150,000 years ago, you will not see much difference when compared with today's brains. Yet the drive to learn, as well as our ability to communicate and work collectively, has lifted our human potential to unimaginable levels </text>

Of course, it could be that moving too quickly to alleviate the world's water shortage is counterproductive to the future interests of the plutocrats. &nbsp; &nbsp;</text>

	<text>hydroponics since hydroponics use a fraction of the water that outdoor crops use, do you think that's the future? &nbsp;or is it just not practical for developing countries? i've always wanted to come up with a simple design for hydroponics that could be easily built. i even bought the piping and whatnot to try one myself (found a vertical hydroponic design online) but haven't had a chance to try it out. &nbsp;i am a total city slicker and all my attempts at growning stuff outdoor has been pretty miserable. &nbsp; i'm sure my indoor food attempts will be just as bad at first. &nbsp;i would use a house-attached temporary south facing hoop type greenhouse probably if my next home purchase allows for it.... people should really respect farmers. &nbsp;it's very hard work.</text>

	<title>A Container, a Wick, and Vermiculite</title>
	<date>Sat Jul 02, 2011 at 06:45:52 PM PDT</date>
	<author>coldwynn</author>
	<text>A Container, a Wick, and Vermiculite Some use a perlite/vermiculite mixture. &nbsp;Capillary action can draw up the nutrient solution through the wick. &nbsp;Coil the wick on the top layer. &nbsp;Throw seeds, try lettuce, and wait. &nbsp;Experiment with wicks before selecting one for your system. &nbsp;Using food coloring in the water helps to gauge flow rate for various wicks you're experimenting with. You can also buy a bag of potting soil, lay it on its side, slice it longitudinally, and plant seeds or slice small plus signs into the plastic and plant the seed. &nbsp;Don't remove any plastic because it helps to retain moisture. &nbsp;Poke some drainage holes on the bottom too. Take a look at aeroponics as well. &nbsp;The additional oxygen to the roots increase growth rate, but it's not as tolerant of power outages or equipment breakdown as hydroponics.</text>

	<author>emeraldmaiden</author>
	<text>I tried the vermiculite alone, and I think I need a mixture, as it's so dry here. It may be that I need to rig a cover to keep the moisture in, as well. The seeds I'm trying are lettuce and spinach. I'm hoping the next variation of design will help. Our patio garden is doing really well; we have tomatoes, cucumbers (in a pot) and eggplants (also in a pot). The tomatoes are 7' tall. We soak them at ground level, and have mulch to keep the moisture in the soil.</text>

	<text>And food crops should not be used to power autos. Holiday traffic on I-70 going west from Denver may break all records this weekend, according to the Denver Post. In our area, we can barely get onto the rural highway that takes into town or out or our area. It's choked with trucks, monstrous RV's pulling SUVs, campers, cars--you name it. &nbsp;So much for people driving less because of gas prices.</text>

	<text>+ Dubai The 16 most water-stressed states on Earth are all in that troubled region, with Bahrain at the top of the ranking from risk analysts Maplecroft. Libya, Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia and Syria follow not far behind. See Johann Hari 11/28/2009, Dubai Has Always Been Bankrupt -- Morally and Environmentally: But Dubai's bankruptcy does not end there: it is ecologically bust. This is a city built in the burning desert, where everything shrivels up and blows away if it is not kept artificially cold all the time. That's why it has the highest per capita carbon emissions on earth – some 250 percent higher even than America's. The city has to ship in desalinated water – which is more costly than oil. When it runs out of cash, it will run out of water.</text>

While we do have an amazing sense of inquisitiveness, we also seem to have the fatal flaw that our acquisitiveness takes precedence, and is capable of snuffing out all other higher faculties. We seem determined to destroy ourselves. Scary, and very sad.</text>

	<text>Fellow Futurama fan here;) The new season is airing now here in the states;) Caught this on a friend's FB page: The new African land grab This is a ground-level view of a large land deal in Africa, where in recent years foreign investors have acquired tens of millions of hectares of farmland. In 2009 alone, the World Bank estimates that around the world foreign investors acquired about 56 million hectares of farmland - an area about the size of France - by long-term lease or by purchase. Farmland has become a favourite "new asset" class for private investors; "like gold, only better" according to Capital &amp; Crisis. Critics of the phenomenon - farmers' movements, human rights, civil society, women's and environmental organisations, and many scientists - call it "land grabbing". They say there is no way that the taking over vast areas of smallholder farmland and transforming it into giant industrial plantations and agribusiness operations can ever be "responsible". They argue that land grabs are throwing millions of farming families and indigenous peoples off their land. They say that it's not just land that's being grabbed, but also precious water resources.</text>

	<author>the fan man</author>
	<text>Patric, I know you know that most of the water used for agriculture is wasted. Channel irrigation is the least efficient, the most used, and the most likely to leave accumulated salts in soils, raising the water table and eventually making some soils barren. There is so much to do that can reduce water needs in ag. Middle eastern countries, while attempting to "grow their own", are better served in the short term by buying on the international market, while running the risk of price spikes caused by variances in dollar exchanges and grains used weapons. In fact, that is what is contributing to ME instability, not local yields. It's not just dictators that need cheap food by a long shot, many developing countries subsidize food as a way to stay competitive in the global labor market. Hell, it was one of the reasons industrial ag was promoted in the states at the turn of the 20th century (also to prevent political upheaval after several bad harvests and commodity spec way back then).</text>

	<author>Snud</author>
	<text>Not sure how effective this is but It may be a wee bit of good news and certainly sounds interesting: Drinking water can be extracted from the humidity in the air even in the desert or in the middle of a megacity, which is made possible by a technology developed by Fraunhofer. The principle behind it is a salt solution that runs down from a tower-shaped system and absorbs water from the air. The hygroscopic brine is then pumped into a tank that stands a couple of meters high and contains a vacuum. Then, energy from solar collectors heats up the brine and the evaporated salt-free water condenses over a distillation bridge. The brine concentrates again and flows down on the surface of the tower to absorb humidity in the air. This process is exclusively based on regenerative sources of energy such as simple solar collectors and photovoltaic cells, meaning that this method is completely energy self-sufficient. That means that it functions in areas where there is no electrical infrastructure. This process is particularly well suited for extracting drinking water in arid and semi-arid areas where more water evaporates than precipitation falls. </text>

In the central Sierra, late spring measurements showed the snowpack was 164 percent of the regional average, said Dave Rizzardo, snow survey chief with the California Water Resources Department. Frequent rain and snow storms through the late winter and a chilly spring created unique summertime ski conditions, he said. "We've had a phenomenal season," said Squaw Valley marketing manager Sean Kristl. The resort's accumulated snow this year was nearly double the area's average.

	<title>water  availability</title>
	<date>Sat Jul 02, 2011 at 11:26:15 PM PDT</date>
	<author>Pete Rock</author>
	<text>water  availability Most fresh water goes into aquifers or into the sea, carrying dissolved mineral salts with it and raising the salinity very slightly over millions of years. Less than 2% of the surface water is fresh,meaning drinkable. Even worse, much of that water is increasingly contaminated, or bacteria laden or otherwise not potable for humans. With the sea level rising, the obvious solution is large scale desalinization. Why doesn't America have large scale demo projects to show a successful desal/electric plant out of solarized &nbsp;photo thermal plant with condensation leading to fresh water? And why aren't these plants helping to alleviate the stress on fresh water supplies all over the South East and South West? &nbsp;The plants probably could run full bore 8 months of the year with variability in sun available for the winter or fall months in the Middle Atlantic, other parts of the country. &nbsp;grey water mandatory recycle/reuse is another must. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do it before it becomes impossible to catch up. &nbsp;Municipalities, counties should be doing these plants just as they do sewage treatment in the usual loop.Water is getting more expensive because it is getting scarcer. it is stress on the limited supply of fresh with so many more people and industries demanding it. Added to the climate challenge. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the drought affecting so many regions, cutting government investment in infrastructure "to promote a healthy economy " is just nuts. We didn't do it during WW 2 and we have a War on Nature otherwise known as global climate change that is now fierce, and needs remediation not just a wait for to heal by itself in spite of more insults and assaults on reason.</text>

	<title>Water, is not classified and priced properly.</title>
	<date>Sun Jul 03, 2011 at 09:36:48 AM PDT</date>
	<author>Pete Rock</author>
	<text>Water, is not classified and priced properly. clean potable water is of course most valuable. yet communities price it as if a golf course or an industry gets it as cheap as a household for domestic, kitchen use when it is many times over used as cheap cooling or industrial process and flushed and dirty beyond simple municipal &nbsp;plant cleanups. The true costs are based on the quality of water acquired and the remediation costs of water discarded or recycled. The economics of recycling are met by city populations with a treatment plant. When industry loads it up, and dumps its problems into the system, they get the subsidy and take advantage. using water improperly (using potable when a lower quality of grey water would suffice), and foisting off the expense of restoring it. &nbsp;That's our system at work. Just think of the vast demands of nuclear for cooling and hydrofracking for pushing vast amounts of water underground to extract oil and gas. &nbsp;Without much regulation, adding to the scarcity and making the ordinary citizen pay for it. With all the billions of people on the planet and the intense shortages already, water is a key player in relieving stresses and improving the landscape. Political will, good examples have to be found nurtured and made the dominant paradigm. As opposed to the freebooting exploitation and shifting the burden even more on those unable to bear it.</text>

	<text>I agree with the section headline... Water shortages threaten renewable energy production, experts warn. Indeed. Reading this report from Suzanne Goldenberg is even more depressing. Absolutely, but the examples cited include non-renewable energy sources: fracking in particular doesn't belong in the same paragraph. I'm surprised that solar thermal is cited, as the systems I've seen are either closed-loop water recirculating systems that rely on little outside/ongoing water, or heated-oil systems that are waterless.</text>

	<text>Excellent diary, AAF. Thanks for depressing me...really, thanks. I think we can start with getting rid of the traditional water-wasting flush toilet. I live in an area where composting toilets are permitted the next county over but not in my county. Also, putting an end to vineyard permits. Not only are big bidness types tearing out well-established forests to plant yet another vineyard, they're exporting our water supply one bottle at a time...</text>

	<text>Bush's ranch in Paraguay I thought maybe this was a good time to remind people that GWB &nbsp;allegedly bought a 98,840 acre ranch in the Paso de Patria area of Paraguay, which happens to sit on top of Guarani, the worlds largest fresh water aquifer.</text>
