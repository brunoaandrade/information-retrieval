	<text>  Another year is almost over, so it's time for another YEAR IN REVIEW. &nbsp;I'm going through all my WAYR since Jan 1, and the results are below the fold.   The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science &nbsp;by Richard Holmes. &nbsp;A history of science in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, told through biographies of people like Joseph Banks, Humphrey Davy and William Herschel. &nbsp;Brilliant. Anathem by Neal Stephenson. &nbsp;An amazing book. &nbsp;Very hard to describe, I am not even sure it's a novel. &nbsp;But I reviewed it here. &nbsp; The annotated Alan Turing by Charles Petzold. &nbsp;This is a brilliant idea. &nbsp;Petzold has taken Alan Turing's classic paper on computability and provided extensive, paragraph by paragraph commentary on it, making it comprehensible for a lot more people (like me). &nbsp;This sort of thing should be done more often. Augustus: The life of Rome's first emperor &nbsp;by Anthony Everitt. &nbsp;I had trouble with this one and gave it up. &nbsp;Maybe it's because I don't know much about Rome. The autobiography of Mark Twain. &nbsp;Twain's autobiography is unusually structured, there's a very long introduction. &nbsp;But, even once you get to the meat of the book - it's boring. &nbsp;I stopped reading. Bloodsucking Fiends: A love story &nbsp;by Christopher Moore. &nbsp;One day Jody, a beautiful redhead (she thinks she needs to lose 5 pounds) wakes up as a vampire. Now she's a BLOODSUCKING FIEND. with superhuman strength, an allergy to sunlight, and a taste for blood. &nbsp;Worse, she'll never lose those 5 pounds. &nbsp;Needing a daytime helper, she recruits C. Thomas Flood, a wannabe writer from Incontinence, Indiana. &nbsp;Young love can be hard when one is the food source for the other! &nbsp;A vampire novel that only Moore could write. &nbsp; Bones of Betrayal by Jefferson Bass. The fourth in the Body Farm novels, which are about forensic anthropology being used to solve crimes. This time, a famous scientist is dead after swallowing a highly radioactive pellet, and the protagonist, Bill Brockton, must figure out whodunit. &nbsp;One of the authors (Jefferson Bass is a pseudonym for two people) is one of the world's leading experts in this field, so the details are right. &nbsp;Good read. &nbsp;Full review here A Case of Exploding Mangoes A comic thriller set in Pakistan when Zia Al Haq was PM there, and Reagan was POTUS here. &nbsp; Funny stuff. &nbsp; Company &nbsp; by Max Barry. &nbsp;This is a darkly satirical and very funny novel about corporate life in the modern world. &nbsp;Full review Cows in the maze and other Mathematical Explorations by Ian Stewart, which I got an advance copy of. &nbsp;Lots of games and puzzles, from the Scientific American column. &nbsp;I wrote a full review here Eat my Globe by Simon Majumdar. &nbsp;Around age 40, Simon Majumdar decides to spend a year eating and traveling. &nbsp;A yummy book. &nbsp;full review Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson. &nbsp;A very good book that includes material from Einstein's letters. Full review The Fellowship by John Gribbin. &nbsp;About the founding of the Royal Society and the scientific revolution. &nbsp;I am fascinated by this period, but found this rather slow going and eventually gave it up. Finding our Tongues: Mothers, infants and the evolution of language by Dean Falk. &nbsp;Wonderfully written and engaging, this is scholarly writing at its best. &nbsp; Speech - and language generally - is the quintessential human activity. &nbsp;While there are arguments about whether other primates can really learn a language, or how much language some other species have, there's no doubt that no animal uses language to the extent that we do. &nbsp;How did this happen? &nbsp;Full review Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, Evolution by Ray Jackendoff. &nbsp;All about language; a technical introduction to linguistics for the motivated layperson. &nbsp;Fascinating. &nbsp;And anyone who thought all the geeks were studying math, physics and computer science should have a look. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larson. &nbsp;Great mystery novel with a couple of very brutal scenes. &nbsp;Lives up to the hype. The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larson. &nbsp;The third book in the series that started with Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and continued with The Girl who Played with Fire - these should definitely be read first. &nbsp;This one is also very very good. The Girl who Played with Fire by Stieg Larson. &nbsp;The sequel to Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. For me, this one started a little slower, but is gradually building in intensity. &nbsp;Excellent. &nbsp;But read Dragon Tattoo first. Going postal by Terry Pratchett. &nbsp;Wonderful stuff. Full review The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman. &nbsp;A father's day gift from my kids. &nbsp;A fantasy novel. &nbsp; The gone away world by Nick Harkaway. &nbsp;A combination of a coming of age novel, an apocalyptic SF novel, an adventure novel and a martial arts novel, all mixed together, with lots of humor added. &nbsp;A lot of fun. A Great Deliverance by Elizabeth George. &nbsp;The first of the Inspector Lynley novels. &nbsp;I'm not sure why I've never read George before, but this was really good. &nbsp; Heaven's Prisoners the second in James Lee Burke's Dave Robichaux novels. &nbsp;Like the others in the series, it is good, but dark in mood. Hidden Harmonies: The Lives and Times of they Pythagorean Theorem by Robert and Ellen Kaplan. &nbsp;Just started. &nbsp;The publisher sent me a review copy because I've admired other work of the Kaplans, and this looks very good too. &nbsp;This is one for math amateurs - and, if a good song makes you want to sing along, a good math book makes you want to prove along. &nbsp;Reading this, I found myself thinking thoughts about the theorem. Full review Ideas: A history of thought and invention from fire to Freud by Peter Watson. &nbsp;A fascinating and amazingly learned history of ideas. &nbsp;Watson thinks much more highly of fire than of Freud. The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the dark ages by Chris Wickham. &nbsp;A really good history of Europe and western Asia, from 400 to 1000 AD. Jingo by Terry Pratchett. &nbsp;More glorious Discworld fun. &nbsp;Years ago, Klatch and Ankh-Morpork fought over a small island of no particular significance. &nbsp;It sank. &nbsp;Now it's arisen again, and the war is on! &nbsp;Pratchett aims his satire at prejudice and the sort of blind patriotism that is pathetic. Full review: Lamb: The gospel according to Biff, Christ's childhood pal by Christopher Moore. &nbsp;Very funny and very sacrilegious. &nbsp;Biff, Christ's childhood pal, has been brought back to life to fill in the missing parts of the biography of Jesus. &nbsp;This book, a series of long flashbacks, tells how Joshua (you know him as Jesus) and Biff (not mentioned much in the Bible) meet Mary Magdalene ("call me Maggie") and then venture to find the three wise men, so Josh can make sure he really is the Messiah (he is) and what he's supposed to do about it. full review The Last Continent by Terry Pratchett. &nbsp;The incompetent wizard Rincewind is stranded in a strange land where there's no rain, lots of sheep, and everyone has odd ways of speaking English. &nbsp;This is the Discworld, so it can't really be Australia, can it? &nbsp;Still, there's lots of beer, so no worries. The Mathematical Experience by Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh. &nbsp;What math is really all about. &nbsp;Excellent short essays. &nbsp;I wrote a full review here A mathematician's lament: How school cheats us out of our most fascinating art form. &nbsp;A really great book about math education. Anyone involved with math or teaching should read it. Full review Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People who Cook by Anthony Bourdain. &nbsp;This is sort of a sequel to Kitchen Confidential. &nbsp;Bourdain is now older, much wealthier, more mature and probably happier. &nbsp;This is a good book, but what made Kitchen Confidential so remarkable was that ... well, the author was young, poor, immature and something of a a jerk. &nbsp;I'd much rather KNOW the current Bourdain. &nbsp;But I think I'd rather READ the earlier book. &nbsp;Still, there's some great stuff here, including a hysterical chapter on Alice Waters. Full review Men at Arms by Terry Pratchett. &nbsp;Leonard of Quirm has invented a gonne, and while no one wants this device that shoots things duplicated, no one is willing to destroy it. &nbsp;And Carrot Ironfounderson has been promoted to Corporal. &nbsp;and there's a move on to restore kings to Ankh Morpork, and evidence that the rightful king is named .... Carott. &nbsp; Wonderful, as Pratchett always is The Mind's Eye by Oliver Sacks. &nbsp;More neurological case histories from the eminent Dr. Sacks, these all focus on vision, and how it can go wrong. &nbsp;What strikes me most about Sacks is his humanity. Full Review Mistakes were made (but not by me) by Carol Tavris. &nbsp;All about cognitive dissonance and how we justify our own actions. &nbsp;Excellent book about how we all fool ourselves and how memory works (and doesn't). A lot of information on cognitive dissonance and other topics, very clearly presented. Moving Pictures by Terry Pratchett. &nbsp;Lights! &nbsp;Camera! &nbsp;Action! &nbsp;Holy wood is coming to Discworld! Murder on the Trans-Siberian Express by Stuart Kaminsky. &nbsp;One of the Porfiry Rostnikov novels, and one of the better ones in this series, which takes place in contemporary Russia. &nbsp;But you should read them in order, if you can. &nbsp;If you want a great tool for finding books in series, I review one here. &nbsp;This is the 14th. &nbsp; Neon Rain by James Lee Burke. &nbsp;The first in the Dave Robichaux series about crime in New Orleans. &nbsp;Noir and good. Reading this on my Kindle The New Space Opera 2 ed. by Gardner Dozois and Jonathan Strahan. &nbsp;A collection of science fiction short stories in the "space opera" style. &nbsp;Mostly, I like them. A Plague of Secrets. &nbsp;Another in the Dismas Hardy - Abe Glitzky series of courtroom thrillers, and just as good as the others. &nbsp;If you like this series, or courtroom dramas generally, you will probably like this book. Poetic Form by David Caplan, since I've been playing with some poetry. &nbsp;It's pretty good. The Pursuit of Glory: Five revolutions that made modern Europe: 1648 - 1815 by Tim Blanning. &nbsp;To quote the NY Times Book Review: "History writing at its glorious best". &nbsp;Blanning is a highly knowledgeable guide to this period, but, more than that, he has a talent for pointing out the odd fact and making it fit into a bigger picture. &nbsp;He makes observations that strike you as obvious - once you've read them - and draws you into the narrative. &nbsp;Anyone with interest in this period should read this book The Professional by Robert Parker. &nbsp;This will be one of the last from Robert Parker, who died recently. &nbsp;I wish I could say great things about it, but I can't; I can, however, say good things about it. &nbsp;The usual Parker skills are here - there's good dialogue between Spenser and Susan Silverman and between Spenser and Hawk. &nbsp;The plot zips along with no big holes. &nbsp;There's the usual discussion of the meaning of love. &nbsp;But it lacks the zip that some of his earlier stories had, and Parker's musings on the ethics of the main villain are odd indeed. The Reality Dysfunction by Peter F. Hamilton. Far future science fiction of the space opera variety. &nbsp;Just started. Riding the Rap by Elmore Leonard. &nbsp;Typical zaniness from Leonard. &nbsp; Ringworld by Larry Niven. &nbsp;SF set in the fairly distant future, in the Known Space universe. &nbsp;Humans named Louis Wu and Teela Brown and &nbsp;a kzin named Speaker to Animals set off for the Ringworld, led by a mad puppeteer named Nessus. &nbsp;The Ringworld is an artificial world shaped like a ribbon around a sun, and it's 9 million times the size of Earth. &nbsp;Wonderful Full review Rough Country by John Sandford. &nbsp;This is the third in the Virgil Flowers series of mysteries. &nbsp;Set in northern Minnesota, Flowers is called when a woman at an inn is murdered. &nbsp;Typical of Sandford, with tight plotting, spare dialogue and interesting characters. Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices by Noah Feldman. &nbsp;The story of Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, Felix Frankfurter and Robert Jackson, and how they worked with (and against) each other on the Supreme Court, which was once described as "Nine scorpions in a bottle". &nbsp;An absolutely wonderful book. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the Supreme Court, the constitution, or this period of US history. &nbsp;Full review Small Gods by Terry Pratchett. &nbsp;In this one, Pratchett goes after fundamentalist religion. &nbsp;This is, I think, the first of the Discworld novels to show that Pratchett is more than a funny writer, but also a wise and brilliant one. Full review: Society without God by Phil Zuckerman. How life is lived in two of the least religious countries on Earth: Denmark and Sweden. &nbsp;Just started this book, but it demolishes the argument that societies without God would be hellish, crime-ridden or whatever Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor. &nbsp;The story of the battle for Stalingrad, and surrounding events. &nbsp;Brilliant, harrowing, informative. &nbsp;The eastern front gets much less attention than the Pacific or western fronts, but the scale of destruction and loss of life was huge. &nbsp;The only problem I have is who to root for. &nbsp;One has to root against Hitler, of course. &nbsp;But it's hard to root for Stalin in any real way, despite the fact that they were our allies at the time. &nbsp; Stiff: The curious lives of human cadavers by Mary Roach. &nbsp;This was recommended in last week's WAYR, and it's really interesting. &nbsp;But you probably don't want to read it over lunch. Star Island by Carl Hiassen. &nbsp;Just what you'd expect from Hiassen - funny and criminal goings on in South Florida. &nbsp;Full review Strange Curves, Counting Rabbits, and Other Mathematical Explorations by Keith Ball. &nbsp;An excellent popular math book, for an audience who has perhaps had a semester or two of calculus at some point (although it's not strictly necessary). full review Tai Pan by James Clavell. &nbsp;I am rereading this. &nbsp;Like Shogun it's a big, sprawling book in which the hero (an Englishman) goes to the Asia (in this case, China and Hong Kong), does all sorts of great things, adopts some Asian ways (e.g. not dressing in long woolen clothes when it's 90 or 100 Fahrenheit), falls in love with a beautiful Asian woman ... etc. &nbsp;Fun stuff. The Stupidest Angel by Christopher Moore. &nbsp;More hysterical satire from Moore. &nbsp;Full review: Thief of Time by Terry Pratchett. &nbsp; At the behest of the auditors (who want to get rid of humans because they are messy) Jeremy Clockson is building the perfect clock. &nbsp;If he completes it, the universe will end. &nbsp;It's up to Lu Tze and his acolyte Lobsang Ludd to stop him. &nbsp;With some help from the history monks. This is your brain on music &nbsp;by Daniel Levitin. &nbsp;Fascinating. &nbsp;One of the few traits shared by every human culture is music. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;What does it do? How does it work? &nbsp;Mothers everywhere seem to sing to their babies. &nbsp; Levitin started as a musician and producer of music, then got interested in the science of sound and music perception. &nbsp;How do we recognize songs? &nbsp;Why do we like some music more than others? Thomas Paine and the birth of Nations by Craig Nelson. &nbsp;A pretty good biography of the American writer and revolutionary. &nbsp;Paine was born poor, and was buried in an unmarked grave. &nbsp;In between, he became one of the most celebrated (and best selling) writers on two continents. Thud! by Terry Pratchett, which was a birthday gift from my son. &nbsp;He figured out I liked Pratchett, but ... well, I had read it, but re-reading is good. &nbsp;Thud! &nbsp;is one of the better Discworld novels, which makes it very good indeed. &nbsp;Commander Vimes must stop a war between the trolls and dwarfs, solve a murder, and get home in time to read Where's My Cow? to his son. &nbsp; Varieties of Scientific Experience: A personal view of the search for God &nbsp;by Carl Sagan. &nbsp;Sagan gave the Gifford Lectures which had also been given by William James. James' series was written up as Varieties of Religious Experience, and Sagan makes a play on that title. &nbsp;This is a look at the religious (or not) views of a man who was much more than a science popularizer. &nbsp;It's a little disappointing, especially the second half, which simply re-hashes some well known arguments re God's existence. Full review Voodoo River by Robert Crais. &nbsp;The fourth Elvis Cole novel. &nbsp;In this one, he is hired to find the birth parents of a famous actress who was adopted at birth. &nbsp;It looks like a standard case. &nbsp;But, once Cole flies down to New Orleans, it turns out there's more than crawfish on his plate. &nbsp;People are getting killed. &nbsp;And he's falling in love (or a strong case of high-minded lust). Fun and easy reading. The Wages of Genius by Gregory Mone. &nbsp;Einstein had a big head as a baby, and studied physics. &nbsp;Edward also has a big head and studies physics. &nbsp;Edward thinks he's the next Einstein. &nbsp;But he doesn't really get math well, so he switches tohistory of science, and he's not making much progress on his dissertation, but nothing will dull his sense that he is the equivalent of Einstein. &nbsp;Then he gets hired by a mysterious internet startup, where he has rather nebulous duties. &nbsp; Very funny. Waiting for Aphrodite: Journeys into the Time before Bones by Sue Hubbell A fascinating and wonderfully written look at invertebrate zoology. &nbsp;Small vital creatures. &nbsp; William Blake: Collected Poems, I got this one for my Kindle and now I can't find the edition I got. &nbsp;But it's all the poems. &nbsp;I have to get this in print. &nbsp;Reading poetry on the Kindle just isn't the same. &nbsp; Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel. &nbsp;Historical fiction about Henry VIII and that period, told from the point of view of Thomas Cromwell, with the villain being Thomas More. &nbsp;Wonderfully written, and, from what I read in other reviews, historically defensible. Worth dying for by Lee Child. &nbsp;Another in the Reacher series. &nbsp;But it's going downhill. &nbsp;My review. Year's Best Science Fiction by Gardner Dozois. &nbsp;In my opinion, the best of the annual anthologies. &nbsp;Full review &nbsp; You Suck by Christopher Moore. &nbsp;I am only a few pages into this novel about two people who are young, in love, and .... oh yeah, dead. &nbsp; Young Miles by Lois McMaster Bujold. &nbsp;I got this at the recommendation of several people last week, and it's really good. &nbsp;Miles, scion of a noble family on Barryar, has washed out of the military because of bad bones. &nbsp;But now he's going to have adventures. &nbsp;Fun stuff. &nbsp; </text>

	<text>Discovered Terry Pratchett I read Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Already a big fan of Neil, but Pratchett was a new discovery. So I've read 6 Discworld novels so far, including the young adult series about Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men. They were great. Laurie R. King The God of the Hive. The latest Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes. I ADORE this series, and the last two installments were Laurie at the top of her game. Brightsided by Barbara Ehrenreich was a great read. She dissects the "positive thinking" pop-psychology phenomenon, and shreds it with ruthless logic and humor. Griftopia by Matt Taibbi, a must-read if you want the full picture of the mortagage bubble, the financial melt-down and just how much Goldman Sachs Sucks.</text>

Now I'm reading "Mockingjay", the last book in "The Hunger Games" trilogy. &nbsp;Good reading for a young adult series. &nbsp; Next on the list is Ken Follett's new book: "Fall of Giants". &nbsp;I really enjoyed "The Pillars of the Earth" and "World Without End", so I'm hoping this matches up. Starting a book club with some friends, first book up is Little Bee. &nbsp;Anybody read it yet? Thoughts on it?</text>

	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 04:15:30 AM PST</date>
	<author>teacherken</author>
	<text>what I read this year lots of books on education, especially those by Darling-Hammond, Flat World and Education, and Ravitch, the Death and Life of the Great American School System Looking back, I actually read about 20 books on education, but did not choose to write about all of them. Almost no fiction this year. Also books by Krugman and several other economists also books on the environment my reading was way down this year - partly a product of having 192 students - &nbsp;that's a lot of reading of student papers and I probably blogged too much. &nbsp;My post this morning was my 356th here this year, at least according to this search, and as you know I read all the comments on my diaries. Have a blessed New Year's. &nbsp;Was delighted to finally meet you.</text>

	<title>Teacherken seems like a perfect place for a break</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 06:22:57 AM PST</date>
	<author>4CasandChlo</author>
	<text>Teacherken seems like a perfect place for a break Many have provided a very diverse list of authors but most tilting very much toward the "high end" literature. &nbsp;May I tell of one of my guilty pleasures that comes out at years end? I love the "Best of Year" books, such as The Best Science Writing of 2010, The Best Short Stories of 2010, The Best Sports Writing of 2010 . . . and so it goes. These are typically periodical stories (many high brow!) that are exhilarating, informative and very very user friendly. &nbsp;Every year I am full of self-satisfaction that I have read much of "The Best Political Writing" and every year I learn so much from the Best Science, Best Nature etc. And, let me let some of you in on a secret, some of the best writers going right now are sports writers. &nbsp;In the Best Sports writing, you are not going to find in depth articles on 3-4 versus 4-3 defenses, rather, you will find poignant, often tear inducing humanistic writing that only sports can bring out. &nbsp; I am sure many of you are also fans, but for those that scuffow at the racks of these at Borders, give one or two a try, you might well be hooked, you will definitely learn.</text>

	<text>I was resistant at first. I have to admit that what eventually got to me was the fact that it is instantly gratifying. &nbsp;I can download what I want, when I want (usually). &nbsp;I am entirely too impatient and I read a lot. &nbsp;And once I got it, I discovered I had a lot less eye fatigue reading on it. I'm a tech writer and I do almost all of my editing on a computer screen. &nbsp;At the end of the day, when I would want to read what I wanted to read, I hated that my eyes got so tired so fast because I'd been sitting in front of the computer all day. But I still love print books (there is something indescribable about the way a real paper book feels, and even if the Kindle is kinder to my eyes, it is definitely different), and I totally get your point, especially because you work in a bookstore (probably akin to why I won't shop at Whole Foods--I also work in a small, locally owned health food store). &nbsp;</text>

	<text>one thing about digital readers... they don't put decaying-paper dust in the air. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, depending on what you read, they can take a H*LL of a lot of dust out of the air! What we went for first was Baen's backlist, because: &nbsp;a) the older stuff is mostly free, b) rates for the non-free are quite reasonable, and c) we had literally TONS of ancient, deteriorating paperbacks in the house. &nbsp;Both of us life-long hard science fiction readers. &nbsp;(We knew it was true love when we de-duped our collections shortly after we got married!) &nbsp;Old paperbacks Definitely contra-indicated with my husband's many allergies. It's also wonderful that Himself now can read in bed so much more easily, and has something to do while waiting in the car while I do the running-in-and-out.</text>

	<text>Libertarian SF?? yes, Ringo's &amp; Stirling's politics are definitely "teh suck", but they can both, blast them, WRITE STORY!!! &nbsp;The kind of thing where you kind of hold your breath while their characters are bombasting and then get sucked right back into the main storyline (feeling slightly slimed, but there's STORY coming!). they both also have REALLY unfortunate psycho-sexual (and I DO mean PSYCHO) proclivities! &nbsp;As you have some idea if you've read all the Nantucket's. &nbsp;There's some of that in the first few volumes of Stirling's "Dies the Fire" complement to Nantucket, but it seems to be decreasing as the main story proves more and more popular. If you really want to choke your way through something, try Ringo's "Last Centurion"... he really let himself go with the politics (almost no sex of any sort) and pontificating. &nbsp; They are both HIGH, HIGH on my "guilty pleasures" list.</text>

	<title>Finished "Room" by Emma Donoghue</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 04:42:02 AM PST</date>
	<author>Rented Mule</author>
	<text>Finished "Room" by Emma Donoghue A simple existentialist nightmare. A woman is kidnapped and placed in a carefully constructed room. Her abductor regularly rapes her over the years, resulting in a son born into this room. The novel is told in the voice of 5 year old Jack that knows nothing of reality outside the room. &nbsp;The only natural light is a skylight towards which they &nbsp;focus their screams, just another activity to fill out their day. There is a TV in the room, usually turned to cartoons. Any "real world" information gleaned from the TV is simply regarded as "shadow on the wall of Plato's cave." Ma carefully constructs a world with enough activity to make Jack's life tolerable, even comfortable in an 11 by 11 room/womb. After settling into the cadence of 5 year old's voice, the structure becomes unique, concepts explained circuitously by the limits of a 5 year old's vocabulary. His innocence, wisdom and love need few words to convey. The action never stops. When Old Gus, the kidnapper, cuts power and nourishment for a few days, Ma begins to formulate a new ending to her nightmare. I could hardly put this book down as I watched Jack begin to understand what was required of him. This book is revelatory. You will read few books like this in your lifetime.</text>

	<text>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks... was one of the top two books I read this year. For those of us whose work absolutely depends upon HeLa cells, it was a long overdue biography of one of the most important figures in all of modern science. And for those os us whose lives absolutely depends upon HeLa cells, it as a long overdue homage to one of the most important figures in all of medicine.

Loewen In The Graveyard of Empires by Seth G Jones Deadly Spin by Wendell Potter I have a couple more that I'm starting. I read a few chapters then I end up starting another book.

	<text>The Kindle is dangerous, isn't it? And damn those samples! &nbsp;They give you just enough to make you hit the "buy" button. &nbsp;I wondered if I'd take to reading on the Kindle, but I have to say, I love it. &nbsp;I also get my newspapers (and my Daily Kos!) downloaded right to it. It's become something of an inanimate pet that goes everywhere with me...lol. I do the same thing that you do and usually have at least a few different things in mid-read. &nbsp;It also leaves my husband befuddled! &nbsp;But I like having several things available when I want to sit down and read. &nbsp;I never know what I'm going to be in the mood for. &nbsp; "Lies My Teacher Told Me" is in my wishlist. &nbsp;I've also been eying "Cleopatra." &nbsp;What do you think of it so far?</text>

	<title>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 05:07:46 AM PST</date>
	<author>gongee</author>
	<text>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds because his music counts as literature. Amazing in it's narrative storytelling and emotional depth. Nick has been among the most literate rock stars for decades. Often dark yet sometimes sweet and breezy his output spans the gamut and is equally matched by precise and eclectic musicianship. One of Australia's greatest exports. 1986 - Your Funeral, My Trial - to me it marks his emergence from youthful restless aggressive, semi-industrial work of Birthday Party and early Bad Seeds (which in itself is phenomenal) but has an air of maturity while still being dark and brooding. 1988 - Tender Prey - An all-time classic. The cover image says it all. Dark and very intense. A lot Old Testament references to vengeance wrath. Contains the classic, The Mercy Seat. 1992 - Henry's Dream - Another standout. Excellent storytelling. 1993 - Live Seeds - A ferocious live set. 1994 - Let Love In - A bit more mature with keen and shrewd music and lyrics. 1997 - The Boatman's Call - Practically a solo album. Slowed down, deeply personal, with tremendously introspective lyrics. And that's just a smattering of his body of work. Oh yeah, he also writes books and screenplays and film scores.</text>

	<text>I liked "At Home"; amusingly informative, but a bit England-centric. &nbsp;He paints a pretty grim picture of much of English history; Victorian England comes across particularly badly. &nbsp;I'm not sure, however, how applicable a lot of what he writes is to places other than post-Roman, pre-modern England. &nbsp;Anyway, it's an interesting read, if a little gag-inducing in places (London streets thick with human waste; the consequences of believing that baths can make people susceptible to the plague...). &nbsp;The book definitely made me feel lucky to be living when and where I do!</text>

	<text>Poor Gordon Brown. He really is British to the core in terms of that sort of solipsistic nationalism that runs rampant here. I'm doing an MA in arts policy and management, which unfortunately deals mainly with the Labour years since all Cameron has done so far is axe just about everything everywhere and there's nothing to study. The policy sections contain a lot of unintentional hilarity centering around some rather naive beliefs in globalisation. I suspect reading the White Papers put out by other departments would make for a lot of grins and giggles too.</text>

	<title>I have the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 07:13:13 AM PST</date>
	<author>karmsy</author>
	<text>I have the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying on my bookshelf. I love the intricate descriptions of the after-life in the Tibetan cosmogony, and sometimes read then at night when I can't sleep. Also, Rinpoche (whom I'm not sure I respect, for other reasons), promotes the idea of meditating, not for solace when things are difficult, but when you're already feeling good. A novel suggestion we don't hear much elsewhere, since other spiritual practices are so focused on pain as a symptom.</text>

Hodgell. My nephew-in-law has a share in his family's Iowa farm, and he's deeply worried about global warming. &nbsp;I saw "The Biochar Revolution" recommended on the International Biochar Initiative site, so I got two copies and gave him one for Christmas. &nbsp;I'd previously given him my copy of "The Biochar Solution" by Albert Bates, and I've emailed him links to interesting biochar sites. &nbsp;It's too early to go into this in a big way, but if he's aware of it and experimenting on a smaller scale, that will give him a head start when they start paying farmers to sequester carbon.</text>

	<title>The Denial of Death</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 05:48:27 AM PST</date>
	<author>aravir</author>
	<text>The Denial of Death written by Ernest Becker. This commentary on death and man's attitude toward death is a fascinating read. &nbsp;I'm not a big fan of Freudianism, and this author draws on Freud, as well as Kierkergaard and Otto Rank, but I'm in the mood for a literary repast on this subject. As for the rest of the year, I'd say my top read was The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony by Roberto Calasso. &nbsp;In this brillian rumination on Greek mythology, Calasso combines fact and fiction in an entirely original work. &nbsp;If you are a fan of great writing, read this book. One book I did not read this year, but recently recommended as essential in another diary is The Apostles of Disunion by Charles B. Dew. &nbsp;Puts the lie to the claim from Confederate sentimentalists that the secession was not about slavery. For anyone interested in investing or mob psychology, the classic Extraordinary Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by Charles Mackay and first published in 1841, is a must read. Anyone who is a position to provide care or assistance to an autistic person should read No Fighting, No Biting, No Screaming by Bo Heilskov Elvan. &nbsp;Great new book, with useful tips on how to be most effectively useful. &nbsp;Highly recommended. Best fiction? &nbsp;Heck, that's hard. &nbsp;So much of the fiction I read this year was "junk food". &nbsp;Guilty Pleasure? &nbsp;James Patterson. &nbsp;Takes me back to my childhood, when I used to sneak-read Harold Robbins under the covers. &nbsp;(Not that the authors are the same,just that both authors are lousy writers with style.) &nbsp;One book that Patterson co-wrote with Gabrielle Charbonnet did not totally suck: Sundays at Tiffany's. &nbsp;Actually very touching. Out of the non-junk fiction category, I suppose my favorite was Labyrinth by Kate Mosse. &nbsp;The story shifts between now and Carcassone at the time of the Cathars. &nbsp;I have been interested in that story for a long time, so this book intrigued me. May we all find that one book we have been seeking, this year.</text>

	<text>I am now reading Saturday by Ian McEwan and as I hated "Atonement" I am already not the slightest bit enamored with yet another gimmick-filled, self-conscious romp. Unfortunately, it is assigned to my January term class because it plays with time in fiction, which is our topic. We are also assigned Box of Matches by Nicholson Baker, which is also a bit gimmicky but far better prose. That book is basically one chapter for each morning this guy gets up and just thinks. It was annoying me until I started to read it one chapter per day, and that made it actually make sense.</text>

	<text>I'm reading it now.  I was surprised to learn how crazy the Ptolemies were. &nbsp;I've read a lot about Alexander the Great, and had the sense that the first Ptolomy was downright stable and sensible compared to the rest of the contenders for Alexander's empire. &nbsp;I have to re-evaluate him based on the snakepit he seems to have set up for his descendants in Egypt! Given how little data Schiff had to go on, I think she's done a great job bringing Cleopatra and that time to life.</text>

	<text>The Road by Cormac Mccarthy had the biggest impact on me this year, largely because I have a son the same age as the boy in the book. &nbsp;It was a tough read. The Way We Live Now by Trollope was pretty good. Globalization and its discontents by Stiglitz. &nbsp;The book is a little old, but still good. &nbsp; The Commanding Heights - Daniel Yergen. &nbsp;I re-read this. &nbsp;In my view globalization remains the central issue of our times, and Yergen's book is a good summary, though a little dated. &nbsp;Oh, and I don't agree with him. Right now I am reading Tony Blair's biography. &nbsp;The similarities to Obama are a little stunning, and mroe than a little disturbing.</text>

	<text>First, a fan message... Thanks plf515, for posting this series! &nbsp;I don't often have time to hang out and comment, but I try to always catch the diary. &nbsp;It's such a great resource. &nbsp;I picked up Anathem on your recommendation, and I think it's the top runner for my favorite book of this year. Other stuff I've read this year: Stephenson's "Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon"(and I've started the Baroque trilogy), some William Gibson ("Neuromancer" &amp; "Spook Country"), lots of Neil Gaiman, "Good Omens" by both Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, some Pratchett ("Going Postal" and others), the Stieg Larsson trilogy, Christopher Moore's "Lamb," the new David Sedaris ("Squirrel seeks Chipmunk: &nbsp;A Modest Bestiary"), "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" (I can't believe I'd never read that before), some Howard Zinn, and lots of other stuff I just can't remember off the top of my head right now. &nbsp;Oh, I re-read the Harry Potter books this year, too. &nbsp;We read the first two out loud to our 3-year old son, and I just kept going. &nbsp;Maybe it's not very "grown up" of me, but I can't help it--I love Harry Potter. &nbsp; There's more. &nbsp;That's probably just the stuff I've read in the past 6 months or so, and I just can't remember any more. &nbsp;Getting older and having to give up caffeine really stinks. &nbsp; &nbsp;</text>

	<text>They are young adult novels if by "young" you mean "not dead yet". I think they get labeled that because 1) The protagonist is a child and 2) They don't have much sex in them. (Nor does most of the rest of Pratchett's work, of course)</text>

	<title>Too much to list all</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 06:33:13 AM PST</date>
	<author>barbwires</author>
	<text>Too much to list all But some of my favorites last year: The Larsson books-he definitely died too early. Inspector O series by Frank Church (read 3 of the 4 so far) very brutal, somewhat surreal, set in No. Korea which probably accounts for both features. &nbsp;Absolutely love the character and musings of the prinicipal detective. God of the Hive by Laurie King. &nbsp;I like all of Laurie King (and I think I have read them all; some of her books I genuinely love). She has a long running Sherlock Holmes pastiche that is overall very good. This book (one of the better of that series) has a character named Robin Goodfellow that has to come back. &nbsp;(If you do the Sherlock Holmes series they are worth starting from the beginning "The Beekeepers Apprentice.") The Hunger Games and sequelae by Collins. &nbsp;Fascinating, well written and reminded me very much of a mental "arena" game I played as a child; which argues for a very disturbed childhood. In the "young adult" category but I would posit these are more adult than adolescent. &nbsp;Very good for budding peace activists. A disappointing book: The last ghost written Robert Jordan. &nbsp;Should have stopped when he was still alive.</text>

	<author>JBL55</author>
	<text>I've been focussing on children's lit My about-to-be-nine year old grandson doesn't read like I (and his parents &amp; grandfather) wish he would, so I'm reading things I know he likes so I can understand what appeals to him and act accordingly. &nbsp;As a result I've read things like the Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Flat Stanley series. &nbsp;Any recommendations will be gratefully accepted! I just finished War Horse by Michael Morpurgo (1982) and plan to turn him onto it when he visits in February (before Spielberg's film version comes out). &nbsp; Also on the list: Farmer Boy (which we started during his last visit and which he likes) and The Phantom Tollbooth. Of course I'm also encouraging his parents to read a lot ... in front of him. &nbsp;This is not easy, as their house is full of videos (both good and bad) and the TV is on almost constantly. &nbsp;But when they visit us, the TV is rarely on and I'm happy to report there are no complaints.</text>

	<title>"Reveille for Radicals," by Saul Alinsky</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 06:50:48 AM PST</date>
	<author>karmsy</author>
	<text>"Reveille for Radicals," by Saul Alinsky It was published in 1946, and my copy was acquired by the local library back when the overdue fine was still .03 a day. Rather than railing and moralizing a la RW politicians, Alinsky observes natural human tendencies and cites them as evidence of human striving for worthwhile aims such as public participation. For instance, one public meeting, perhaps a city council meeting, that Alinsky discusses, started at 7 pm and was projected to run for 3 hours. At 2 am, the meeting was still going strong, because so many people wanted to speak up. Alinsky saw a natural need on the part of the many participants to participate in a democratic forum, and inadequate opportunities. As I noted in a comment in an earlier thread, another book by Alinsky, "Rules for Radicals," is perpetually checked-out at the library, with many holds placed on it. It was pointed out that this is a popular book with the RW these days, as well as progressives. The RW would do very well to &nbsp;learn from Alinsky's knack of observing and examining, rather than simply passing judgment all the time. Next on the list: "The Global Forest," by Diana Beresford-Kroger</text>

	<text>I just finished taking the fourth case of books I read down to the basement library. More than 220 books, all read this year, including three that I am sorry I wasted my time on. Brad Thor writes crap. About one a year. People who stumble upon him end up praying for contagious constipation, so as to save any future potential readers from accidentally finding one of his books and reading it. The First Commandment was so bad, that I felt as though the christian hand of god came down from the skies, intent on grabbing me and shaking me out of my misery. A moment later, I realized that it was a really bad fart. I was forced to vacate my chair due to the retched odor. His books are so bad, so predictable, so lame and so badly edited, that I had to look him up on Wiki. Yup, as I suspected. He is a frequent commentator on Fox, especially on Glenn Beck's show. Pro christian, anti-muslim, pro- surprise attacks against our "enemies," who are loosely defined as those individuals who don't watch Fox 24/7. Luckily, I got these books for free and the author realized no royalty income from mois. DO NOT READ THESE BOOKS, not if you want to think rationally.</text>

	<text>WAPO blog Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency June 24, 2007, Washington Post http://www.washingtonpost.com/...  Part One: 'A Different Understanding With the President':  In less than an hour ... Cheney's proposal had become a military order from the commander in chief. Foreign terrorism suspects held by the United States were stripped of access to any court -- civilian or military, domestic or foreign. They could be confined indefinitely without charges and would be tried, if at all, in closed "military commissions." "What the hell just happened?" Secretary of State Colin L. Powell demanded ... when CNN announced the order that evening, Nov. 13, 2001. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice, incensed, sent an aide to find out. Even witnesses to the Oval Office signing said they did not know the vice president had played any part. "Angler," as the Secret Service code-named him, has approached the levers of power obliquely, skirting orderly lines of debate he once enforced as chief of staff to President Gerald R. Ford. He has battled a bureaucracy he saw as hostile, using intimate knowledge of its terrain. He has empowered aides to fight above their rank, taking on roles reserved in other times for a White House counsel or national security adviser. And he has found a ready patron in George W. Bush for edge-of-the-envelope views on executive supremacy that previous presidents did not assert. Over the past six years, Cheney has shaped his times as no vice president has before. [The] relationship [between Bush and Cheney] is opaque, a vital unknown in assessing Cheney's impact on events. Officials who see them together often, not all of them admirers of the vice president, detect a strong sense of mutual confidence that Cheney is serving Bush's aims.   http://blog.washingtonpost.com/...</text>

	<author>anyname</author>
	<text>The Angeler http://www.amazon.com/... Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency  Angler, Gellman&rsquo;s embargoed and highly explosive book, is a work of careful, concrete, and original reporting backed by hundreds of interviews with close Cheney allies as well as rivals, many speaking candidly on the record for the first time. On the signature issues of war and peace, Angler takes readers behind the scenes as Cheney maneuvers for dominance on what he calls the iron issues from Iraq, Iran, and North Korea to executive supremacy, interrogation of Al Qaeda suspects, and domestic espionage. Gellman explores the behind-the- scenes story of Cheney&rsquo;s tremendous influence on foreign policy, exposing how he misled the four ranking members of Congress with faulty intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, how he derailed Bush from venturing into Israeli- Palestinian peace talks for nearly five years, and how his policy left North Korea and Iran free to make major advances in their nuclear programs. </text>

	<text>Just started... Out of the Dark by David Weber. &nbsp;Based upon the description I've read of the book, it's a bit of a mash up between alien invasion of earth and vampires. &nbsp;Mankind is brought nearly to it's knees when vampires emerge from the shadows to deal with the invaders (at least that's what I got from the description). &nbsp;I'm not even 50 pages into it so I can't say if it's good or bad. I'm also half way through the audiobook version of The Windup Girl by Paulo Bacigalupi. &nbsp;This is one of those sci-fi books set in the not-to-distant future where food is in very short supply, the oceans have risen dramatically due global warming and the world is totally run by corporations. &nbsp;I'm about half way through and I think things are finally going to really get going. &nbsp;It's pretty slow going up till now though so I hope it picks up. &nbsp;</text>

	<text>So many books, so little time... I'm currently in the middle of Stone's Fall by Iain Pears, whom I discovered through his wondrous book The Dream of Scipio. Late last year I discovered Reginald Hill's series of mysteries set in Yorkshire and centered on a police department with some unforgettable characters -- Dalziel, Pascoe and Wield. The best of the lot (so far) is Pictures of Perfection. In non-fiction, one of the most rewarding reads for me was Patt Lind-Kyle's Heal Your Mind, Rewire Your Brain, which was recommended in a WAYR diary. Thanks for that! It generated a tremendous creative surge in my artwork</text>

	<author>EquationDoc</author>
	<text>Stalingrad is a must-read... especially for Americans who think the US won the war. The Russians faced approximately as many German armies as the US faced German divisions. The US did a great job of mopping up the German army after D-Day, but the war was decided in the East, and Stalingrad was pivotal. And Beevor's coverage is an utter masterpiece. His other book The Fall of Berlin, 1945 is every bit as masterful. ~Doc~</text>

	<text>2010 Highlights  Reinhold Niebuhr, Moral Man and Immoral Society, for which there was a book club here earlier in the year. &nbsp;It was interesting to see people's reactions to the religious chapter. &nbsp;"Wait - this is what religious arguments are like?" &nbsp;(Currently reading his Faith and History: A Comparison of Christian and Modern Views of History.)  Richard Horsley (ed.), In the Shadow of Empire: Reclaiming the Bible as a History of Faithful Resistance, very clear essays about the anti-imperialist thrust of most biblical trajectories. &nbsp;(Links to my review.)  James Cone, Martin and Malcolm and America, a comparison of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, which shows their common rootedness in a common African-American religious ethos.  Louis Ruprecht, This Tragic Gospel: How John Corrupted the Heart of Christianity, a no-holds-barred slam on the Gospel of John by a scholar of Hellenic thought.  Mary Daly, Quintessence... Realizing the Archaic Future: A Radical Feminist Manifesto, not Daly at her best, but interesting.  Ellen Harris, Handel as Orpheus: Voice and Desire in the Chamber Cantatas, a musicological study of the style and texts of Handel's cantatas, and a hypothesis of Handel's homoerotic preferences. More, but I got to jump in the shower.</text>

	<text>Thanks for recommending Wolf Hall it was a wonderful read and others are now reading it due to my rec. Jane Slayre, "the Literary Classic with a Blood-sucking Twist" &nbsp; hum, will not be reading anymore of these. &nbsp;One is enough. Also, avoid any Richard Castle book, as it was very poor. &nbsp;I did not purchase any of these books, they were at the library, so don't mourn for my pocketbook. &nbsp;I am also learning to put the book down, walk away if it doesn't get into my head within a decent number of pages. &nbsp;At my age, this is true wisdom. Oliver Sacks' The Mind's Eye, was a complex and amazing read. &nbsp; The cookbook I flipped through this week, Bobby Flay's Throwdown. &nbsp;Joe Barnett's shrimp and grits, lovely recipe and wonderful photo. &nbsp;Check it out.</text>

	<title>Franklin and Eleanor</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 08:20:43 AM PST</date>
	<author>anninla</author>
	<text>Franklin and Eleanor Franklin and Eleanor by Hazel Rowley...just finished. &nbsp;Very good, interesting, etc. About their marriage....began as a marriage of love/fondness, ended as a marriage of convenience/fondness. &nbsp;No startling new revelations, but very readable. Was amazed that the press and all the people connected to the R's kept his crippling condition from the American public. &nbsp;Also notable was how history repeats itself: you will see Republicans using the same dirty tricks and tactics now as they used then. The rhetoric used against R &amp; his New Deal is what we are hearing now against Obama &amp; any legislation he supports: socialistic, communistic, anti-American, dictator, power-mad, anti-business. However, R. used the force of his personality to personally engage the American people against the rhetoric...he engaged them constantly, and fought back against the Republicans' charges, and got the people on his side while doing so. &nbsp;He did not waste opportunities...he was bold, bold, bold. Almost on a daily basis, I wish Obama was much more like FDR. I can recommend all 3 of Stieg Larsson's books. They aren't the best mystery/crime books in the world, but they sure have something...page turners, work avoiders, stay-up-laters. Betty White has enjoyed a revival of late, and I found a "bargain book" of hers, "Here We Go Again" published in 1995. What was interesting was her accounts of her early days in radio and TV...when TV was just getting started and was wild &amp; wooly and live. Terribly interesting for us old farts. Also enjoyed Michael Caine's new autobiography, "The Elephant to Hollywood." &nbsp;Class act all the way. Ken Follett's "Fall of Giants," while not as engrossing as his earlier bestsellers, "The Pillars of the Earth" and "World Without End," was engrossing....events leading up to, and through, and immediately after..World War I. &nbsp;It is part one of a trilogy. &nbsp;I just love trilogies! &nbsp;Recommended highly for the history and the plot. The end.</text>

	<title>Coming to the end of Freedom</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 08:42:19 AM PST</date>
	<author>jip99</author>
	<text>Coming to the end of Freedom by Jonathan Franzen. &nbsp;A big disappointment, between the huge build-up and my fond recollection of The Corrections. &nbsp;There isn't a single character in Freedom who isn't unlikeable, unsympathetic and generally unpleasant to be around. &nbsp;So much so, that I have to assume this was intentional on Franzen's part, somehow part of his point. &nbsp;The characters basically fall into two groups, the insufferable depressed passive-aggressive personalities and the insufferable selfish bastards/bitches. &nbsp;Individuals are principally distinguishable within these groups by the depth of their self-awareness, which ranges from non-existent to total, the latter cases offering a slender thread of tolerability. &nbsp;That said, the book is beautifully written and 562 pages is flying by, but I'm going to think long and hard before starting his next one. Didn't realize this would be a year-end round-up edition, or I would have reviewed the accumulations on shelf and Kindle from the last year and collected my thoughts. &nbsp;As it is, a few titles stand out in memory. &nbsp;The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Matterhorn, A Visit From the Goon Squad, Who Fears Death, The Hunger Games trilogy. &nbsp;I know there were others, but these were knockouts for me.</text>

	<title>I'm on my second reading of Progeny</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 09:09:26 AM PST</date>
	<author>Donna O</author>
	<text>I'm on my second reading of Progeny If you're a fantasy fan, R.T. Kaelin's first in a series, Progeny, is a very satisfying excursion into a world of magic, myth, and a bit of mayhem. In a land where magic is outlawed, a young brother and sister discover that they are key to the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, and that they could be imprisoned, banished, or even put to death when their emerging magical powers begin to manifest. The characters are richly drawn, and I found myself developing an emotional connection to them from the get-go. I was enchanted by the concept of the "Strands," shimmering strings of light that are woven into various patterns to accomplish everything from healing to mass annihilation. For me, it evoked comparisons to what I know of string theory, and the potential power that lies within each of us. I highly recommend this book for those who love fantasy. Even those who've never explored the genre will be drawn into Kaelin's richly realized world where ancient gods and goddesses sometimes do interfere in the affairs of man. I couldn't put it down the first time around, and I'm discovering even more meaningful nuances the second time through. And, as an aside, R.T. Kaelin is a Kossack who writes under the name of bobcatgrad!</text>
