	<text>  A Bloomberg article this morning, Dodging Repatriation Tax Lets U.S. Companies Bring Home Cash, discusses a meeting held December 15th between President Obama and some of the captains of industry, of the arrrrrrrr variety, &nbsp;who requested &nbsp;a tax holiday for their offshore hordes of money, to the tune of over $1 trillion buckeroons. &nbsp;The bucks are sitting in offshore tax havens and these giants of capital would like to bring it home without any pesky reductions, especially the 35% tax they are by law supposed to pay. They want it all, you see. &nbsp;They absolutely want it all. Will Obama give them what they want? It sounds like another gush of bottom to top with very little trickle down to me.   Apparently he&rsquo;s thinking it over, having Tim Geither look into it over the holiday. Though he did say differently on the general topic while he was advertising for our votes.  President Obama, who campaigned in part against companies&rsquo; use of offshore havens to avoid U.S. taxes, asked Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to follow up on the issue with business leaders, according to a White House official who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.   The oligarchs asking for the holiday argue that the savings from these nasty taxes will trickle down on all the rest of us slobs in the form of economic boosterism. Yeah, right. From the article,   What nobody&rsquo;s saying publicly is that U.S. multinationals are already finding legal ways to avoid that tax. Over the years, they&rsquo;ve brought cash home, tax-free, employing strategies with nicknames worthy of 1970s conspiracy thrillers -- including "the Killer B" and "the Deadly D." Merck &amp; Co Inc., the second-largest drugmaker in the U.S., last year brought more than $9 billion from abroad without paying any U.S. tax to help finance its acquisition of Schering- Plough Corp., securities filings show. Merck is also appealing a federal judge&rsquo;s 2009 finding that Schering-Plough owed taxes on $690 million it had earlier brought home from overseas tax-free. The largest drugmaker, Pfizer Inc., imported more than $30 billion from offshore in connection with its acquisition of Wyeth last year, while taking steps to minimize the tax hit on its publicly reported profit.   The same article provides the argument against giving a tax holiday, calling it a short term solution that doesn&rsquo;t address &nbsp;what is clearly a very long term problem.  Such a move "is a short-term fix to a long-term problem, which is the uncompetitive U.S. tax structure," said Cisco spokeswoman Jennifer Greeson Dunn. The San Jose, California- based company reported $31.6 billion of undistributed foreign earnings, on which it had paid no U.S. taxes, as of July 31. ~snip~ The argument that a new tax break for offshore earnings would generate a domestic stimulus "holds no water at all," said Joel B. Slemrod, an economics professor at the University of Michigan&rsquo;s school of business and former senior tax economist for President Reagan&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers. U.S. companies are already sitting on a record pile of cash -- $1.9 trillion in liquid assets, according to Federal Reserve data.   When someone who worked for Reagan during the height of voodoo economics says it doesn&rsquo;t hold water, why the hell would the White House even consider the preposterous idea. Goddammit, Obama, don&rsquo;t give these bastards another bonus all wrapped in red ribbon, while regular people are losing their pensions and homes. Just say NO! Yes, you can! For more info, I searched for other relevant articles. These two favor the idea of a repatriation tax holiday. I have a feeling more will be coming out after the new year. Cisco meeting with Obama a good photo opp Tax U.S. companies into spending UPDATE: I found another piece, a NYTimes article, which discusses a similar requests for repatriation tax holiday that was awarded in 2009 as the "Homeland Investment Act". A study was conducted after the fact, which showed that the tax savings were rewarded to stock holders, not the economic infrastructure as promised. These greedy bastards can't be trusted. Simple as that. Here's the additional link: Tax Break for Profits Went Awry </text>

	<title>Here it is in the Washington Post.</title>

	<author>Fossil</author>
	<text>Here it is in the Washington Post. Andy Stern proposes that and speculates that it would create jobs. This is precious:   Corporate Repatriation Dollars to Fund Infrastructure Jobs U.S. multi-national corporations have parked an enormous amount of income overseas. And current tax rules and loopholes allow corporations to defer taxes on current income by storing it outside of the country. The end result is that these corporations have accumulated massive amounts of income overseas that have never been taxed. There are many good arguments for corporate tax reform that make the United States more competitive on a global scale. Many argue that we need to lower rates and we need to close the loopholes. But, while we wait for this argument to conclude, workers sit home unemployed and the overseas money is not put to good use in the U.S. economy. So, let&rsquo;s revisit the idea of a one-time repatriation tax break. I&rsquo;m talking about a tax on past foreign earnings with a twist. We put the government&rsquo;s share of the money; say $30 billion, into an Infrastructure Bank. We could also put the money into a Green Bank or other long term job creation programs. That $30 billion would leverage $180 billion more in investment. For every $1 billion in infrastructure spending, 40,000 direct and indirect jobs are created. Even without leverage, we could create 2.4 million jobs with this funding. With leverage, 8.4 million direct and indirect jobs could be created and we could create the 21st century infrastructure system we need in this country. Jobs Created: 8.4 million Cost: $30 billion Pay-for: One-time corporate repatriation tax break Cost to taxpayers: Zero   It's a nice fantasy to think that the government and the corporations will represent the unemployed or do anything other than increase shareholder profit.</text>

	<text>Gnawing on fingernails? I think I am beyond that. &nbsp;I am actually scared. &nbsp;I see productive people who are out of work: I see corporations eliminating engineering staff because they are "growth" companies and eliminating staff is rewarded by Wall Street: I wait for signs of hope from our government, like a coherent industrial, trade and tax policy, but most of all I see where wealth is being rewarded for gambling on the movement of equities and not through profits made through domestic manufacturing. I am scared that what I see in our two parties is one verging on embracing an Authoritarian Religious Dictatorship, and another that may be socially liberal, but is proto-Facist.</text>

All they'll do is create more jobs overseas. ENOUGH is ENOUGH. It does explain why Wall Street has been calling Obama a bully lately. They're trying to intimidate him.</text>

	<text>pretty much, yes, acramer....Free Pass  Obama, who raised $15 million on Wall Street, promised that his administration would "crack down on the culture of greed and scheming" that he said led to the financial crisis. While Obama vowed to change the system, he filled his economic team with people who helped create it.    Timothy F. Geithner, 49, who had been responsible for overseeing banks including Citigroup while president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, became Treasury secretary and named a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist as his chief of staff. Lawrence H. Summers, 56, who is stepping down as Obama&rsquo;s National Economic Council director, opposed derivatives regulation and supported the 1999 repeal of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking, when he served as deputy Treasury secretary and Treasury secretary in President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s administration.   &lsquo;Free Pass&rsquo;  "It was very clear by February 2009 that the banks were going to get a free pass," said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund who is now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Sloan School of Management. "You could see from the hiring of Tim Geithner and from the messages that he and his team were putting out that this was going to go very badly."   http://www.bloomberg.com/...</text>

	<text>A worthy topic with an unnecessarily confrontational tone, in my opinion. &nbsp;"Godammit, Obama" -- really? Anyhoo... If a repatriation holiday is a necessary "sweetener" to close the loopholes going forward (with more comprehensive reform), then I might be OK with it. &nbsp;Hard to see reform passing the 112th Congress without some kind of concession.</text>

	<text>How about a permanent holiday? We should tax income where it is earned only, like pretty much every other country on the face of the planet. The current tax structure is a terribly perverse incentive against using your overseas profits to invest in infrastructure and jobs here in America. It's hard to make putting the factory in America economically viable when you have to take a 35% tax hit just to get the money into the country.</text>

	<text>Our tax code forces companies to move their operations outside the US whenever possible. &nbsp;Then we wonder why manufacturing and now many service operations go to other countries. This is not a matter of lower wage rates in other countries, as many other countries with high wages and large governments have positive trade balances - such as Germany, Australia, Netherlands, Denmark, Singapore, South Korea, Israel, Belgium, Sweden, etc. We need to put a far greater focus on having a tax policy that is at least neutral on the issue of operations in the US Vs outside and stop our insane policy of putting US operations and workers at a major disadvantage compared to every other industrialized country.</text>

	<text>Thanks Here is the link Deutsche Bank Agrees to Pay $553.6 Million to Settle U.S. Tax Shelter Case  Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&rsquo;s largest bank, admitted criminal wrongdoing and agreed to pay $553.6 million to avoid prosecution in the U.S. over fraudulent tax shelters that generated $29 billion in "bogus" tax losses. The U.S. Justice Department, under an agreement yesterday, won&rsquo;t prosecute the Frankfurt-based bank for fraud or tax evasion for enabling wealthy U.S. citizens to avoid $5.9 billion in taxes, after the bank admitted criminal wrongdoing. The settlement includes a $149 million civil penalty, the fees that Deutsche Bank generated from the shelters, and the taxes and penalties the Internal Revenue Service was unable to collect from taxpayers because of the misconduct, according to the agreement. From 1996 to 2002, "Deutsche Bank assisted high net worth United States citizens, who, through 2005, reported approximately $29.3 billion in bogus tax benefits on their tax returns," according to the agreement. "DB acknowledges that it was wrong and unlawful to have engaged in these transactions and regrets having done so."  </text>

This is nothing new. &nbsp;Obama is not complicit so much as shrewd. &nbsp;Geithner is dramatically underappreciated and has helped the nation's economy avoid a Second Great Depression, which almost certainly would have destroyed the global economy as well. You can't lower unemployment without capital investment.</text>

	<title>If it moves money into this economy</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 08:08:32 AM PST</date>
	<author>I love OCD</author>
	<text>If it moves money into this economy I'm not all that upset about it. &nbsp;It's time to come to terms with the reality of where our country is and how shaky it is economically. &nbsp; None of the major corporations has any need for us anymore. &nbsp;They don't need us as primary consumers, although we're handy for that, but we also have laws that less us sue when we're harmed, so why sell to a risky cohort? &nbsp;They don't need many of us as workers, and we're pretty fussy about being paid and having some kind of benefits so we're far more expensive than foreign laborers. &nbsp;They don't need us to vote for Republicans anymore, especially now that the anti-Obama trolls have created the environment that will keep those 2008 activists at home in 2012, so who's going to catch the vote stealing? &nbsp;By 2014 &nbsp;it's probable that all regulatory bodies will be gone, and 90% of government agencies will be empty. &nbsp;You and I won't be chatting about the outrage we feel about that because it's hard to get electricity to tent cities, and only the top 2% will have internet access anyway. I think President Obama is one of the few people who is fully aware of how close this house of cards is to falling, and he'll remain willing to work with the devil if that's the only way to keep the worst from happening. After raging about him for a while, maybe think about how you were willing to be numbed out and dumbed down for the last 30 years. &nbsp;We helped create this problem, we've been willing participants in all of it, for convenience sake and because Americans prefer cheap shit, and lots of it.  &nbsp;</text>

	<title>simply moving money into</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 08:31:52 AM PST</date>
	<author>jfromga</author>
	<text>simply moving money into this economy is not enough, plenty of money has moved into this economy, most of it parked outside of the mainstream, productive investment, or job creating spending. There is an enormous amount of wealth in this country. &nbsp; Its how its being hoarded, spent and invested is what got us into this mess. &nbsp;And not just us, but much of the world. Obama has publicly stated his policy is to bribe the hostage takers in hopes they don't starve everyone. &nbsp;He has to trade increasing economic inequality, greater irrelevance of the average human being to the country's economy for short term gains aimed at a tiny fraction of the suffering. He never is half as frank with the public about what's going on. &nbsp; And the people here are not among the willing participants, most of them have been here and other places, voting, supporting better candidates, being activists, telling anyone who will listen that the system has been rigged, we've been sold out and the media and power structure have devolved to propagandists for the corporate powers that be. &nbsp; If Obama wants to do more than stick a bandaid on the blood gushing from arteries, he needs to start telling the truth. &nbsp; If he wants those of us who supported change we can believe in to still believe he wants change, we need to see some truth telling. &nbsp;Some audacity. He's done many good things. I most certainly prefer him to John McCain or any Republican. &nbsp;But we don't need a little kid with his finger in the dyke, we need a master engineer and a commited work force that understands what must be done and attacks the roots of the problems. &nbsp;He hasn't changed the conversation, he hasn't reset framing or messaging as President. &nbsp; He won't get much out of Congress the next two years. &nbsp;He needs to start talking to the people now. &nbsp;He's got about 12-16 months to change the way America looks at itself before we have further Republican gains. &nbsp; This won't change by playing around the edges. &nbsp; He either goes to the heart of the problem or we resign ourselves to an uglier world, destroyed by environmental catastrophe and war and starvation of people worldwide for the benefit of the multinationals and the few people at the top that control them.</text>

	<text>Or we assume that he's not quite as ebil and stupid and corporate-owned as the trolls want us to believe he is, and understand that the world we currently live in is the world we currently live in, and change is going to come slowly. &nbsp; Ranting and raving about evil corporations is a waste of time. &nbsp;They're evil, they're concentrating the money almost as tightly as it's been concentrated for most of human history, and that never changes until people like us start moving in a new direction. &nbsp;It's not going to happen with government regulation alone. &nbsp;It isn't going to come from Congress or the WH, it's going to come from you and me doing things differently, like not shopping at WalMart, not eating a chain restaurants when there's a local alternative, not buying food from giant chains but being inconvenienced by supporting local co-ops and growers. &nbsp;We have to order every couple of weeks, and go to the distribution point during a 4 hour window the following week. &nbsp;If we run out of eggs, we run out of eggs. Banging on keyboards will not change the world. &nbsp;Living differently changes the world.</text>

Many people don't understand why Walmart is a bad thing. &nbsp;They truly don't. &nbsp; Many people don't have access to alternatives, or don't know how to find them. &nbsp; Obama does things, good things, right things, but he never drives the point home, he never shows why 'locally grown' is a point of economic independence, a point of saving the middle class, not just a health nut on a do gooder kick. &nbsp; He believes he can fight a stealth campaign against the powers that are. &nbsp; He understands, he gives ordinary people too much credit on the understanding. &nbsp;Yes, change is slow and hard. &nbsp;But persistance is born of belief, and he hasn't gotten enough people to believe. &nbsp; &nbsp;We alone can't do it, but he has more power and ability to do it than any other single human being. &nbsp;He alone can't do it, but he has to put more effort into leading on the truth.</text>

	<text>A lot of people understand why Walmart is a bad thing. &nbsp;And a lot of people feed their families and keep the roofs over their heads working and shopping at Walmart. &nbsp;Do you really think the President of the United States can stand up and bash Walmart and tell people to buy their food locally? &nbsp;I think he would destroy himself and possibly the Democratic Party with a move like that. &nbsp;Am I being naive?</text>

	<text>Did I say he had to bash Walmart? &nbsp;He doesn't have to act like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin to tell the truth. &nbsp; Education is not bashing. &nbsp; Telling the truth can be done in diplomatic ways. &nbsp; He can help people connect dots without saying boycott the evil Walmarts of the world. &nbsp; And all international trade, all large chains are not absolutely evil. But government acting in concert with the largest companies to make competition impossible, to wipe out small locally owned businesses, to have absurd rules that mean only Walmart wins in the marketplace, hurts America and ordinary people. And in many places right now, there is nothing to replace Walmart, but there's nothing wrong with explaining why people might want to look into co-ops, ask their local city councils for zoning and land use rules that help urban farming, create public areas for farmer's markets, etc. &nbsp;Why do you think the right wing keeps attacking urban planning principles and alleging conspiracies by the UN to usurp local control of planning/utilities/infrastructure rules as some socialist plot? &nbsp; Its about keeping control and stifling local enterprise for those 'small businesses' with $300 million plus in sales and over 500 employees that they always talk about. I personally think you are naive about how much typical people understand beyond the bottom line on their monthly bills. &nbsp;They don't know why they have less money and fewer things they can afford. &nbsp; And they think the 'Walmarts of this world' are the solution not the problem.</text>

	<title>the President</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 11:49:15 AM PST</date>
	<author>jfromga</author>
	<text>the President doesn't need to attack Walmart to explain how the macroeconomics of purchasing cheap stuff overseas, tax laws favoring huge businesses over small mom and pop operations, trade policies and the gutting of anti-trust regulation, etc. ad nauseum, mean that ever larger organizations dominate the law making process to favor themselves, stifle competition, actually raise prices while deflating wages, etc., leading to the greatest income and wealth inequality &nbsp;in generations to the detriment of the average American and in many ways, the world economy as the rich gamble rather than invest in productive enterprises. The screeching is already coming, as well as attacks on the President. &nbsp;He has made no coherent counter argument. &nbsp; People need to draw their own conclusions as to where they will shop, where they will buy their food, why local may be in their own best interest. &nbsp;But there is no counternarrative to the lies promulgated on tv, supported by massive 'public interest' campaigns by right wing organizations supporting the interest of 1% of the population. But bashing isn't about truth, its about distortion, and its not what I believe in. &nbsp;Economic competition on a level playing field is an admirable goal. &nbsp;Doing the right thing can be good for people and business. &nbsp;We need the counternarrative to the ad campaigns of big business. &nbsp;Fact gathering isn't all that easy, and as the right wing continues to win the battle against quality public education, it will become less possible. &nbsp;The tools may exist, but people are not adept at using them. &nbsp; They maybe should take the time, but the same pressure that forces them to work for Walmart and shop there, tends to argue against their having the time or ability to do that fact finding. &nbsp;And the belief that people can do their own fact finding ignores the great lengths and the huge amount of money being poured into disguising, burying and distorting facts in the current system.</text>

	<text>I hope you're not serious. The man's a lightning rod for nutcases. &nbsp;If Obama told people it's dangerous to stand on a hill next to a tree during a thunderstorm, Glenn Beck would be drawing maps to direct people to the nearest and highest tree, Fox would be highlighting thunderstorms all over the country, and the loons would be flocking together, complete with some derogatory signage and a lot of self-pity. &nbsp;The left would be slamming him for wasting time bringing the dangers of lightning strikes into the public consciousness at a time when it's so important to be working on (your pet issue here), hills would be littered with crispy critters and Congress would impeach him for seducing morons into deadly behavior. &nbsp; This would all come from his leaving a golf course during a thunderstorm and mentioning that it's not a safe place to be. And I guess I prefer that he not dumb down his message for my sake. &nbsp;It makes no difference what he ways or where he says it if no one is allowed to hear what he's saying or know what he's doing. Gatekeepers on the left and the right are very effective in muffling this president. &nbsp;It's so disheartening I've nearly stopped giving a shit. &nbsp;If Palin wins in 2012 I'll be out of here for good, and won't really be concerned about the hell I leave behind. &nbsp;Mostly people are going to get exactly what they deserve. &nbsp;You'd probably better work on an exit plan.</text>

	<text>If Obama is that muzzled politically, then he can't win re-election. &nbsp;I don't believe he is that muzzled. &nbsp;I believe that when he presents well-supported and factual arguments, he tends to beat back the noise machine. I believe that he needs to do more of it. &nbsp; You indeed seem to be asking him to dumb down his message when you say he is a lightning rod and can't say anything. &nbsp; Pretty much a logical twist in your argument. I don't intend to work on an exit plan, I actually believe in standing and fighting, which is why I advocate the President stand and fight. &nbsp;All the times on the campaign trail when he put forward a well reasoned defense of his ideas, he won out. &nbsp;The race speech, the opposition to the gasoline tax holiday, the inflate your tires correctly controversy, the refusal to join McCain in the 'sky is falling' reaction to the sky falling in October, 2008, he won because he was right, he defended himself ably, and the public believed him and supported him. &nbsp; &nbsp;That man needs to stand up. &nbsp; Even on the tax cut deal which I personally still hate and believe is wrong, the public is supporting him more than the Republicans, despite not really believing wholeheartedly in the policy or that it will help. &nbsp;If he would do what's right, the support would be stronger.</text>

	<text>My question is about how other first-world countries handle this situation, and if any of them have found a configuration that works better than any of the ideas we have for increased compliance. &nbsp;I got no ideas on this, but I'm not convinced the system we have now, even with loopholes closed, is going to get the compliance we need to survive as a going concern. &nbsp;A repatriation holiday basically legitimizes the noncompliance that is already going on, but if we don't have a plan for dealing with the noncompliance, then it doesn't really matter if he does it or not. Perhaps part of the answer is more worldwide enforcement of tax havens, but that's a tall order given the likelyhood havens will just shift around.</text>

	<text>The U.S. is a tax haven  The beneficiaries of this provision are big banks with multinational operations and &nbsp;other big businesses who use the creation of their own financing subsidiary as a way to lower even further their already low US taxes. &nbsp;Remember that although the US statutory rate for corporations is somewhat higher than the norm at 35%, the effective tax rate is in fact lower than the norm, with US corporations among the lowest taxed of all the OECD nations. &nbsp;That means that the US is effectively a tax haven for corporations. &nbsp;Part of the reason that is so is that there are so many exceptions and special provisions worked into the corporate tax regime--exceptions like the "active financing" exception.    &nbsp;http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/...</text>

	<author>oneshot</author>
	<text>She is right about the tax structure The way our corporate taxes are structured now, there is more incentive to produce income outside of the US, than in it. &nbsp;That is a small part of the reason our economy is shedding jobs. &nbsp;The reality of this situation is pretty simple. &nbsp; Corporations will not bring earnings back to the US with the current tax rate. &nbsp;It sucks, and I don't like it, but that is the reality. &nbsp; Corporations will continue to hoard money and shift operations to countries outside of the US, so they can continue to avoid paying as much taxes as possible, unless changes are made. Reform of the corporate tax regulations can be designed to keep money and jobs in the US, while still producing revenue, but it is a very technical and complicated process. &nbsp; Making our corporate tax system competative with those of other countries is a smart and progressive thing to do. &nbsp;It can provide increased economic stability and more jobs if it is done correctly. &nbsp; There are a lot of risks, and it can result in a windfall for corporate execs, but that is not the only outcome. &nbsp; Immediately assuming that this is horrible and another Obama sellout it inaccurate and shortsighted. &nbsp;Something that benefits corporations is not necessarily detrimental to the middle class. &nbsp; I would suggest that we do some research and educate ourselves on this issue before jumping to conclusions. &nbsp;Knowledge is power.</text>

	<text>Agreed.  That is why I believe that our corporate tax structure needs to be reformed. &nbsp;Tax policy should always be structured to provide the most economic benefit to the country. &nbsp;That is no longer the case with corporate taxes. &nbsp;Tax/Trade reform along with loophole closing is a good place to start. &nbsp; However, any new policy will almost certainly contain benefits for corporations, otherwise there will be no incentive for them to make any changes. &nbsp; That doesn't mean that it won't also be beneficial to our economy or to the middle and lower income classes as well.  My concern is the fact that there are so many here that instantly reject any idea that may benefit the wealthy, without even considering the overall impact of the policy. &nbsp;Jumping to conclusions without knowledge is how the Sarah Palin crowd operates. &nbsp;I am hoping that we will be better than that here.</text>

	<text>Hiya cosmic! I'm going to think of this as being just like when these big company guys first dabbled in overseas markets and had to learn- fast- how to pay bribes properly. Taxes here are just another price of doing business, but first we need to figure out how much that price is going to be and what that money can do for us. Maybe I'm naive, but I'm actually thinking that this is a good sign- that risk-averse companies think the US is a better bet than foreign financial markets. Well, maybe better from our perspective, but worse from the European side (and that reminds me to check my pitiful retirement account for offshore funds and dump them soon.) If it weren't for the econ blogs, I would be totally at sea with all this recession/ depression stuff. The macroecon behind all this is way outside my skillset, but wanting to see the historic patterns in current events is always an occupational hazard. I've been gamely struggling through the econ blogs trying to get a handle on stuff without the media filter gumming things up. Good for you for throwing this issue into a diary. I'm really glad to see somebody open the floor to discussion in a traditional orange-blog kind of way. Have a happy new year and take pix of the snowy cacti for us! &nbsp;</text>

	<text>Perhaps there's a path ... ... that would allow them to re-pat the bucks in return for guarantees that they will do certain things that will have a positive effect on the stalled economy. I could live with that.</text>

	<text>Uh As you quoted  President Obama, who campaigned in part against companies&rsquo; use of offshore havens to avoid U.S. taxes, asked Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to follow up on the issue with business leaders, according to a White House official who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.   Unnamed sources, Timothy Geithner, Banksters...yup, all the necessary elements of a Warren fiasco are set into place. Of course, even the quote you provide does not support the claim. &nbsp;  Obama asked Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner to follow up on the issue with business leaders.   Another, very plausible reading would be this. &nbsp;Obama gave these jackasses a 5 minute face-time meeting. &nbsp;Y'know, pictures for the wall of their office. &nbsp;Had no interest in talking about it, and basically brushed them off and told them to talk to Geithner. In sum, we've got an unnamed source, giving us an equivocal report, that amplifies the term "follow-up' to mean something else entirely. I think I'll wait awhile before losing my shit.</text>
