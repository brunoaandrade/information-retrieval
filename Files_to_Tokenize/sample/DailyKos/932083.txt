	<text>  Awhile back, I wrote about (subjected you to?) the initial process of a kitchen redesign project that I'm blogging about in trade with a local interior designer. Tonight, you get to see the next step in that project. I'm about three steps down the road from what you'll see here, and it's been a lot of fun getting here. The food diaries WILL return. It's just that, between my redesign, the holidays, being felled by a seasonal flu, and the other debris that life tossed my way, I haven't produced much of worth food-wise lately. First, a word from our sponsors:  Here at Top Comments we round up some of the site's best, funniest, most mojo'd and most informative commentary. We depend on your &nbsp;help with talent spotting. If you see a comment that deserves recognition, please send it to topcomments at gmail by 6:30 pm Pacific/9:30pm Eastern. Please please please include a few words about why you sent it in as well as your user name) (even if you think we know it already :-)), so we can credit you with the find!    So, the purge of the kitchen is done. I&rsquo;ve recovered from the trauma and have it on good authority that the poor Waste Management folks who hauled away the garbage are recovering nicely from their hernias. I&rsquo;m starting to get used to my stuff being relocated, though I think I&rsquo;ll be battling the muscle memory for a while yet. The reorganization HAS made my cooking much more zenlike. I love having my stuff within easy reach. So now, it&rsquo;s time to give the kitchen a facelift. Get out the paint brushes! Beth swears by the expertise of the folks at a local paint store (as opposed to say, Lowe's or Home Despot), and she&rsquo;s absolutely right to. We went in with one idea, and came out with different paint. I will admit to being a bit trepidatious about the wall color, but I got over it. The end result was and is fabulous - and once again, something I would NOT have gotten to on my own. Ah, the power of professionals. They&rsquo;re worth their weight in gold! So here&rsquo;s the before, where the walls are blue and the cabinets are an oatmeal off white:  One of the things Beth suggested that I would NEVER have thought of was painting the bottom cabinets a darker color than the top cabinets. Since my motto is, "It&rsquo;s only paint!" I figured, what the heck. If I didn&rsquo;t like it, I could change it, right? (My motto has now changed somewhat. It&rsquo;s now only paint if someone else is doing the work! Or until my tennis elbow goes away....) So, the project begins. This involves taping stuff. Lots of taping stuff. To the extent that if I'd been thinking, I would have bought stock in the company that makes that blue tape. And then removing cupboard doors. My painting tarps went mysteriously (and very inconveniently!) missing, something I didn&rsquo;t discover until I was ready to start. So I improvised with trash bags. Learn from my pain. Find the tarps. Or go buy more. There. I have spoken. Ignore me at your own risk. It'll be worth the extra money and irritation at discovering the tarps hidden away in plain sight on the last day of the painting project. Trust me on this.    So the painting of the cabinets was the biggest pain. In the past, we removed the hinges on the cabinet doors. This time, I taped them off. Taping them off actually took longer, but it was much less problematic than trying to get the hinges back in the perfect position - particularly since I was doing all of this on my own. I would say that this, for me, was the biggest "issue". I am NOT a patient person by any stretch, and taping the hinges requires both patience and a steady hand. The application of my iPod with a whole slew of Kim Harrison books did help this immensely. As did constantly replaying memories of the arguments I got into with my husband the last time we did the cabinets and removed the hinges. :) The bottom cabinets got a coat of primer and then two coats of paint. I probably didn&rsquo;t NEED the second coat of paint, but I was SO not going to decide that I did after rehanging those cabinet doors. The top cabinets got two coats of paint. The walls got one coat of paint - thank FSM! I think it's because I used a pretty high quality paint. The coverage was amazing compared to other painting projects I've done using paints from the aforementioned vendors. That whole "you get what you pay for" thing at work, I guess. I was too "in the painting zone" to remember to take pictures of the wall painting part of the project. (Okay, really, I just wanted it done. And to not have to look at paint again for a long, long, LONG time.) For the cabinets, I used a paintbrush - and another bit o&rsquo;advice here - suck it up and pay for the good paint brush. It really is worth it. If you take good care of it, you&rsquo;ll have it around for years to come, and the difference in paint application is very noticeable. For the walls, I used rollers. Since I knew part of the project would involve painting the ceiling (the prospect of which now makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry), I didn&rsquo;t worry overmuch about the occasional paint splotch up there. The whole painting project took 3 days of pretty solid work - mainly because it was only me doing this. Though it doesn't matter how many painters you add to the mix when it's time for the paint to dry. Like bread dough - it's going to do that on its own time. Accept it. And for what it's worth, it&rsquo;s not that my husband wouldn&rsquo;t have helped. It&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m not patient enough to wait for him to not have paying clients and thus the time to help me. Even if it means more work and aggravation for me. Waiting is far more vexing, in my world. Alright, alright. I&rsquo;ll cease my yammering and show you the finished paint project.     And without further ado, here are tonight's Top Comment nominees! First, a submission that came to the TC inbox somewhat circuitously - it's a comment made on Sunday to a diary posted on Saturday, submitted by CanyonWren:  I'd like to nominate this comment (by TexH) for this evening's Top Comment page   From BlueJessamine:  In Maimonides diary today How to Cook Greens, cv lurking gf and boran2 offer advise on how to get this great diary on the rec list.  From sardonyx:  In Stranded Wind's excellent pictorial diary from last night, When I Was Well, glitterscale has a wonderful comment, especially the final paragraph. In Deoliver47's thoughtful diary today Requesting "Grace", TarheelDem reminds us that Grace happens.   My picks:  This thread, started by hotdamn's comment from the FP story about the latest RW lunatic CT, is flat out, irreverently hilarious. On a more sober note, and one that hits smack dab in my home, wrt unemployment, the conversation started by this comment made by dkmich in bobswern's diary, The Theft of Hope, is well worth reading.   Top Mojo excluding search-identifiable tip jars, first diary comments, Cheers and Jeers, and Mojo Friday:   &nbsp;&nbsp;1&#41; This all happened at work tonight by CayceP &mdash; 366 &nbsp;&nbsp;2&#41; 26 million are actually unemployed.... by dkmich &mdash; 125 &nbsp;&nbsp;3&#41; The accumulation and concentration of by hannah &mdash; 104 &nbsp;&nbsp;4&#41; High unemployment as a means to drown govt. by pkbarbiedoll &mdash; 100 &nbsp;&nbsp;5&#41; i saw that, blah. =x by CayceP &mdash; 89 &nbsp;&nbsp;6&#41; I Don't Believe by shanikka &mdash; 88 &nbsp;&nbsp;7&#41; everything seems to be about Obama by jamess &mdash; 82 &nbsp;&nbsp;8&#41; nevermore by Stranded Wind &mdash; 82 &nbsp;&nbsp;9&#41; What I learned by kestrel9000 &mdash; 77 10&#41; The middle class disappeared by ramara &mdash; 75 11&#41; A woman I knew in college by juliewolf &mdash; 73 12&#41; I'm seeing a lot of this lately. by Mike S &mdash; 69 13&#41; too bad Trip Advisor by Exurban Mom &mdash; 68 14&#41; My Mother's Story by yoduuuh do or do not &mdash; 67 15&#41; dead. solid. perfect. by Fogiv &mdash; 67 16&#41; You know what's funny? by Teknocore &mdash; 64 17&#41; Want to really get depressed about the nation's by jm214 &mdash; 64 18&#41; no by Stranded Wind &mdash; 62 19&#41; thank you VERY much madam cuz. by mallyroyal &mdash; 62 20&#41; hi miep by CayceP &mdash; 61 21&#41; I don't make a habit of replying by Yasuragi &mdash; 61 22&#41; Chi miigwech, Sis Dee. by Aji &mdash; 61 23&#41; I wonder if I could ask something? by teacherken &mdash; 60 24&#41; Another part of the picture by Jim P &mdash; 60 25&#41; I am seeing it in my patients by stitchmd &mdash; 60 26&#41; well said by LaughingPlanet &mdash; 60 27&#41; Happy to support you in this by teacherken &mdash; 60 28&#41; Actually, there still are some people alive that by HylasBrook &mdash; 58 29&#41; another story by Miep &mdash; 58 30&#41; Thank you for this diary Deo, and by RadioGirl &mdash; 58  Top Mojo with No Exclusions:   &nbsp;&nbsp;1&#41; This all happened at work tonight by CayceP &mdash; 366 &nbsp;&nbsp;2&#41; Tip Jar by bobswern &mdash; 360 &nbsp;&nbsp;3&#41; Tips for grace. by Deoliver47 &mdash; 346 &nbsp;&nbsp;4&#41; Tips?

	<text>May I recomment painter's tape for hinges and corners, and painter's tape applicators? Makes the projects go faster - well worth the investment IMHO. Looks like a great project. I'm a real believer in making the rooms you spend the most time in as functional and beautiful as possible. It is a project that will pay dividends every day you live in the house, and if you decide to sell.</text>

	<text>thank YOU for the submission! we love submissions! :) and those who send them in - we cannot do this without you guys! and yeah, the project looks good - what's funny is how much better the kitchen looks now - many minor (in cost and effort) changes have been made since the big paint - and it looks and feels so much bigger and better. So far, we've spent $300 or so. I don't think we're in for much more before we're done. I'll make sure I remember that figure when I post the final photos of the project.</text>

	<text>she's used to it frankly, she's almost part of the entertainment 'round these parts. That's probably an awful thing to say, given that she's like 19, but she doesn't know she's that old, certainly doesn't act it, and she benefits when we're jovial - more likely to indulge in her desire for catnip or treats.

	<text>I guess I'm talking about.... ...everywhere there's a top something or other associated with a name. I really don't want to call anyone out. &nbsp;Most are familiar with the ubiquitous names here. They're on the rec list a great deal, they're in the top this or that - they're everywhere - and all the time. Of course there are exceptions - noweasels, for example. Personally as I see the familiar names on the rec list and top lists week after week, I dunno - it takes some of the excitement out of this place. But that's just me.</text>

	<text>If we can swing it, we'll be adding to our expenditures by something like 60% to buy a new (and not cheap!) faucet. I really really want this - but SO do not look forward to installing it. And yeah, I can do that. Though I'll be pushing for the husband to do it, trust me! But if the price of getting the new faucet is my installation labor, I'm all over it!</text>

	<author>asimbagirl</author>
	<text>I am telling you having the input of a design professional has been the best experience EVER. And I will totally cop to looking askance at her with some of the things she's suggested. Then she comes in with pictures and sketches of examples. The two tone cabinet thing being one example. We are on a miniscule budget, so we have to rely on relocating what we can and changing the look of what we have. And she's been utterly spectacular in her suggestions. Like I said in the diary, we're several steps down the road from what my pictures tonight show, and the difference in the look and feel of the kitchen are amazing. It has always been my favorite room, but I find myself getting even more creative in there now. It's a great feeling.</text>

	<text>thank you! I cannot take credit for the color palette - I was dragged here by those who know better than me. And I'm damned glad I was and they do. :) I will post additional progress reports - I'm sort of waiting on some honey-do stuff to be accomplished (in addition to electrical, I also don't build furniture) and slight structural work - then we're done! And it's the closest to the kitchen of my dreams that we'll get until I actually get to a place where we're designing our dream home. And dammit, we WILL get there!)</text>
