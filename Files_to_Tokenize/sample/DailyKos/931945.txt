	<text>   When I was sick ... things were different.  Companion Diary: When I Was Well  This is only the 11th time this has happened on DailyKos. I am so honored ...      &nbsp;I became ill in the summer of 2007. I spent my sick time studying renewable energy, and in the closing hours of 2007 I launched the Stranded Wind Initiative here - my search for a way to use the wind energy we have back home in Iowa ... without building a power distribution network to move it to market.  &nbsp;I wrote relentlessly that year, worked a little bit on a farm, retained one very patient consulting customer who kept me afloat, and I published 224 diaries here totaling almost 225,000 words. I counted noses once - I think there are 631 photos in the 110 diaries that survived the initial editor's knife I took to the collection.  &nbsp;Some day ... maybe ... I will take this larva of a road story and incubate it to book form. In the mean time Kossack who arrived after 1/2009 will have seen none of this.

	<title>not really "gone"</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 11:21:25 AM PST</date>
	<author>Peacerunner</author>
	<text>not really "gone" when a woman has loved a man like Strandedwind, it is not possible to ever be "gone" for your heart will never quite be the same. &nbsp;But what really happened is that he needs to do some very important things in this world and once he got healthier and stronger, and once he added business partners to his endeavors, I was like an energy-sapper for him. He needed to spend 100percent of his time on making this world a better place politically, health-care-wise, etc... &nbsp;I am a simple, gentle soul. Teacher, runner, just trying to live awake and in awe. &nbsp;I don't even own a TV and don't trust media or the bigger social world. I live for moments by waterfalls, purring, sucking cats, a goofy spaniel, my sweet sons. I don't care about money or things. I only care about seeing that sunrise, trying to do good daily in small ways; seeking peace for all. &nbsp;But I am glad that he put me in this story because I hope that I made at least a fraction of the impact on him that he made on me. Truth is, I was never really alive until i met my sweet Strandedwind. &nbsp;Boiling water in the wild; a moment of truth</text>

	<title>when i was sick</title>

	<text>when i was sick &gt; zapping depression - neurogenesis &amp; Brain Caps There is this one story in Oliver Sach&rsquo;s Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain which remains readily retrievable in my memory. A story so utterly mind-boggling, so counter-intuitive, so, as it were, against the grain, that it has hunkered down in my hippocampus, leaving an indelible imprint in the very cellular structure of my brain. The Chapter "Pitch Imperfect: Cochlear Amusia" begins with a quote from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Troilus &amp; Cressida: "Untune that string/And hark, what discord follows!" Here&rsquo;s a paraphrase. An aging renowned composer and conductor visits Sachs to discuss the ever-increasing difficulties in his music pursuant to his increasing hearing loss, accompanied by the loss of absolute pitch. Sachs, along with auditory specialists, concur that the problem is irreversible, due to the natural die off of some of the 4500-odd hair cells within the ear&rsquo;s Organ of Corti. The musician learns to compensate, composing and directing in lower registers (even when these variations grow from 1/4 to over 1 full octave in discrepancies) and soon discovers he can make contextual &lsquo;auditory&rsquo; corrections when working in full orchestra as opposed to with solo cellos, violas, or trombones. He begins to entertain the notion that his problem may be more in his brain. Some time goes by before Sachs receives a letter from the composer, informing him that he has regained his sense of absolute pitch, that once again he can accurately compose, hear and direct music. The change occurred after he received a commission which involved his total immersion in the composition of complex orchestral pieces. Sachs concludes that, despite the non-functionality of significant parts of the musician&rsquo;s auditory processing facilities, becoming totally immersed in music for an extended time, reactivated his cellular musical memory, which resides inside the brain. ***  *** Mirror neurons "Mirror neurons are a kind of &lsquo;neural wi-fi&rsquo; that monitors what is happening in the other people. This system tracks their emotions, what movements they&rsquo;re making, what they intend and it activates, in our brains, precisely the same brain areas as are active in the other person," Goleman explains. "This puts us on the same wavelength and it does it automatically, instantaneously and unconsciously." from the Neural Power of Leadership: Daniel Goleman and Social Intelligence ***  PharmaFacts I think Big Pharma should be required to subsidize the withdrawal of the millions of Americans they have addicted to their anti-depressants and mood stabilizers in lieu of the billions they pour each year into &lsquo;direct to consumer advertising,&rsquo; a practice that was not legal until the Clinton administration (oh, those Clintons, so what favors they might pull in from Pharmaceuticals and MSM on the heels of creating their mind-bogglingly orgasmic financial fiefdom. *** cognitive dulling   &nbsp; &nbsp;The time-limited role of the hippocampus for explicit memory storage has been referred to as systems consolidation where learning-related changes occur first in the hippocampus followed by the gradual development of a more distributed memory trace in the neocortex. Recent experiments are beginning to show that learning induces plasticity-related molecular changes in the neocortex as well as in the hippocampus and with a similar time course. Present memory consolidation theories do not account for these findings.  &nbsp; &nbsp;In this report, we present a theory (the C theory) that incorporates these new findings, provides an explanation for the length of time for hippocampal dependency, and that can account for the apparent longer consolidation periods in species with larger brains. This theory proposes that a process of cellular consolidation occurs in the hippocampus and in areas of the neocortex during and shortly after learning resulting in long-term memory storage in both areas. For a limited time, the hippocampus is necessary for memory retrieval, a process involving the coordinated reactivation of these areas. This reactivation is later mediated by longer extrahippocampal connectivity between areas. The delay in hippocampal-independent memory retrieval is the time it takes for gene products in these longer extrahippocampal projections to be transported from the soma to tagged synapses by slow axonal transport. This cellular transport event defines the period of hippocampal dependency and, thus, the duration of memory consolidation. The theoretical description for memory consolidation presented in this review provides alternative explanations for several experimental observations and presents a unification of the concepts of systems and cellular memory consolidation.  ***  cogitas ergo sum link Circadian rhythms &amp; Depression  ...ever since i was a child, i have had the tendency to create a fictitious world around me, to surround myself with friends and acquaintances who never existed. ( i don&rsquo;t know, of course, if they didn&rsquo;t really exist or if it is me who doesn&rsquo;t exist. on such matters, as in all others, one shouldn&rsquo;t be dogmatic.) ever since i became aware of the thing that I call self, i can remember with mental precision, the figures, the movements, the character and the history of several fictitious people who were, to me, as visible and mine as those things which we, perhaps abusively, call real life. this tendency, which exists since i realized that I was a self, has always been with me, modifying slightly the kind of music it uses to bewitch me but never altering its manner of bewitching. Alternatives, Again *** music, memory and the illusory self  the end of the affair  *** ...when i was sick</text>

	<text>I read and came away with two intertwining thoughts - as an engineer who preferred the science I was enthralled at learning something new in a totally different field, struggling mightily to keep up and was astounded by your mesmerizing comment composed of both beautiful words and pictures. Thanks to both you and Neil.</text>
