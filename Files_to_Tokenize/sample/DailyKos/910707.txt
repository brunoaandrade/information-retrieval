	<text>  Hey gang! &nbsp;When one Googles "wisconsin protests", Fox crap is in the first page of search results. &nbsp;Let's fix that, shall we? Please, when blog writing or leaving comments at other sites, make sure to post links to this and other FDL posts on the topic. &nbsp;(I've gathered up a good collection of boost-worthy links here. &nbsp;I picked these for both being good and because most were already fairly high-ranked, thus easier to push past the Fox crud.) &nbsp;    </text>

	<text>When I googled "wisconsin protests" there was only 1 fox link and it was down near the bottom, though it made up for it's rarity by being way over the top. The link to page says: Union Hate Rally in Wisconsin: Protests Rife With Hitler, Gun ... I assume it helps to click all the sane ones? Not sure how things move up</text>
