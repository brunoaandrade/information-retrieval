	<text>   Welcome to the Overnight News Digest (OND) for Tuesday, December 28, 2010. OND is a community feature on Daily Kos, consisting of news stories from around the world, sometimes coupled with a daily theme, original research or commentary. &nbsp;Editors of OND impart their own presentation styles and content choices, typically publishing each day near 12:00AM Eastern Time. The OND concept was borne under the keen keyboard of Magnifico - proper respect is due. --- This diary is named for its "Hump Point" video: Lowdown by Boz Scaggs   Please feel free to browse and add your own links, content or thoughts in the Comments section. Any timestamps shown are relative to each publication. --------------------------------------- Top News Insurgents combining forces in Afghanistan By (UPI) Rival insurgent groups along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are joining forces to counter stepped-up attacks from U.S. and allied forces, officials say. Various factions that usually compete for regional power are setting aside their differences to form a "syndicate" like nothing seen before, The New York Times reported Tuesday. In one recent attack by insurgents on a base in eastern Afghanistan, dead enemy combatants were identified from three different factions once considered rivals, military officials told the Times. . . . Military officials are seeking to portray the change as something necessitated by increased allied pressure. Three-quarters of U.S. uninsured employed By (UPI) . . . The report by the Kaiser Family Foundation says 57 percent of people in the U.S. under age 65 receive health insurance coverage as an employer benefit. Medicare covers virtually all those who are age 65 years and older, but the non-elderly who do not have access to or cannot afford private insurance now go without health coverage unless they qualify for insurance through the Medicaid program, Children's Health Insurance Program or a state-subsidized program. The report says the recession has resulted in many losing their health insurance because they have become unemployed, but it has become increasingly difficult for many of the employed to afford coverage. . . . Most low-income children qualify for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, but low-income adults under the age of 65 typically qualify for Medicaid only if they are disabled, pregnant or have dependent children. China counts &pound;130bn cost of economic growth By Jonathan Watts China's economic growth is inflicting more than a trillion yuan's worth of damage on its environment each year, according to a government report that increases pressure on planners to slow the breakneck speed of development. In one of the longest-term accountings of ecological degradation, the China academy for environmental planning calculated that the cost of pollution spills, deteriorating soil, vanishing wetlands, and other impacts surged to 1.3tr yuan (&pound;130bn) in 2008. This was equivalent to 3.9% of the country's GDP. Most of these costs do not appear on corporate balance books or government budgets, but they are accumulating year by year to an environmental deficit that threatens the country's long-term prospects. . . . Zhou Ying, vice-minister of water resources, warned that China's loss of soil and water "posed severe threats to the ecology, food safety and flood control". His comments appeared in a China Daily report on plans to tighten penalties on projects that worsen the situation. . . . Government advisers warn the nation's small agricultural surplus is at risk, despite an improved harvest this year. "It's uncertain whether we can keep a sustainable increase in output in the future as the country's grain production capacity is more concentrated in northern areas, where there is a severe water shortage," Chen Xiwen, deputy director of the central rural work leading group, told the media. This followed a similar warning by a UN envoy. Massive gingerbread house recall a reminder that food safety starts in the gut By Bonnie Azab Powell . . . On Christmas Eve, Whole Foods Market recalled gingerbread houses made by Rolf's Patisserie, a "gourmet European-style bakery" in Illinois, and sold through dozens of its stores. Rolf's makes a variety of pastries and holiday-themed desserts that have reportedly sickened approximately 100 people at "a company event, catered party, a restaurant, and holiday party," said the Illinois Department of Public Health. The pastry maker has itself issued a voluntary recall of all its products made after Nov. 1, although consumers will be hard-pressed to identify them. . . . Staph is a particularly hardy bacteria, able to survive drying, high heat, and high salt -- and thus hang out on those gingerbread houses just waiting to attack those desperate enough to eat one. Staph-related food poisoning usually comes on quickly, as little as one to six hours after you chomped on the contaminated item, and abates quickly too, although it can be more serious for children and older adults. But soon we won't have to worry about getting sick from innocuous things like holiday cookies, right, thanks to Congress finally passing the Food Safety Modernization Act? Wrong. While the new law will give the FDA authority to force a recall, should Whole Foods or Rolf's have resisted doing so, and it will require a place the size of Rolf's to have a food-safety and hazard-assessment plan in place (which other regulations have probably already ensured it does), it will not be able to prevent an outbreak like this one. The FDA won't be monitoring pastry factories for workers with sores, or requiring them to test their streudels for staph. It will, however, be coming up with a better way to track products like Rolf's as they get distributed across America. Jos bombing: Politicians 'fuel Nigeria unrest' By (BBC) Nigerian faith leaders have accused politicians of fuelling a recent upsurge in sectarian violence in which 80 people have died. In a joint news conference, Muslim and Christian leaders said politicians were using religion to whip up trouble around the city of Jos. Bombs exploded in several areas of Jos on Christmas Eve, and Christian and Muslim youths clashed two days later. . . . Local politicians are frequently accused of trying to exploit communal tensions for their gain. International Australian rare earths miner leaps on China cuts By (AFP) Australian rare earths miner Lynas on Wednesday said China had slashed its exports quota for the lucrative metals used in flat screens and hybrid cars, driving a 12 percent jump in its share price. . . . Washington has urged China, which holds a near-monopoly on global production, not to use rare earths exports as a political "weapon" after it restricted flow of the commodities to Japan this year during a territorial row. China has denied any political motivation and said Beijing was restricting mining due to environmental concerns, affecting domestic companies as well as foreign buyers. . . . "This provides additional opportunity for Lynas to meet the supply deficit outside of China," said Lynas chairman Nicholas Curtis. Russian Oil Tycoon Khodorkovsky Convicted Again By All Things Considered Imprisoned former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has been convicted on embezzlement and money laundering charges in Russia. Khodorkovsky was once the richest man in Russia, and was nearing the end of an eight-year sentence for tax evasion. . . . . . SIEGEL: You mean this does not strike you as the verdict of a free trial? Mr. HOFFMAN: No, absolutely not. This is an arbitrary verdict. This trial was rigged. The man is accused of stealing all the oil his company ever produced. . . . Mr. HOFFMAN: . . . it's also very symbolic because Putin wanted to show everybody he was in charge. So it's more than just about one man. It's about actually a whole class of people who rose up when the Soviet Union fell apart and were absolutely critical, they were like a pillar in creating a free market in Russia, a chaotic free market in those early years. Azerbaijan invests in education infrastructure By Amanda Erickson . . . A former Soviet Republic nestled in the Caucasus Moutains, Azerbaijan is growing at breakneck speed thanks to profits from a recently-completed oil pipeline. The country's GDP is one of the fastest growing in the world, having doubled in the last seven years. That wealth is trickling down to education in the rural regions, where half of Azerbaijan's population lives. As a result, small, dilapidated rural schools &mdash; some lack basics like heating, desks and books &mdash; are slowly getting a makeover. Nonprofits including Save the Children and World Vision have banded with the Azeri government to rebuild or refurbish elementary and secondary schools throughout the country. Cuba commutes sentence of last death row inmate By (BBC) Humberto Eladio Real, a 40-year-old Cuban American, was convicted of killing a man in 1994 during an attempted insurgency raid. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation commuted his sentence to 30 years in prison. Cuba has had an effective moratorium on carrying out death sentences for years. Jakarta to raise car taxes to ease traffic congestion By (BBC) Drivers in the Indonesian capital Jakarta will face higher taxes in the new year if they own more than one vehicle. . . . "We hope the higher taxes will reduce traffic congestion as the number of vehicle users in Jakarta is already high," Jakarta city administration spokesman Cucu Ahmad Kurnia told AFP news agency. . . . Jakarta has an ageing bus network and no subway system for a population of at least 9m people, although plans for underground rail and monorail are being discussed. Israeli firms back Palestinian city By (Al Jazeera) About 20 Israeli suppliers are helping to build the first modern Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank, but only after agreeing not to use products or services from Israeli settlements. The announcement of involvement by Israeli firms has angered Jewish settlers, who accused the suppliers of caving in to an international boycott of settlement goods and businesses. Bashar Masri, the project's developer, refused to identify any of the Israeli companies which are supplying the project with construction materials, but their contracts were reported by Israel's Army Radio on Tuesday. The West Bank city of Rawabi, being built 30km north of Jerusalem, is a key part of a plan by Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, to lay the groundwork for a future Palestinian state, regardless of progress in peace talks. Tunisia president warns protesters By (Al Jazeera) As tensions over unemployment and poor living conditions flare in Tunisia, president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali has warned in a national television broadcast that protests are unacceptable and will have a negative impact on the economy. In his speech on Tuesday, Ben Ali criticised the "use of violence in the streets by a minority of extremists" and said the law would be applied "in all firmness" to punish protesters. . . . The protest, organised by the Tunisian federation of labour unions, was one of a number of reported public demonstrations across the country. The public defiance marks a rare display of a popular anger against Ben Ali, who has been in power for 23 years. USA Politics, Economy, Major Events Cryptome Exposes CIA Hypnosis Programs By Adam Weinstein Before there was WikiLeaks, there was Cryptome. (And it's probably a safe bet that after WikiLeaks is long gone, there will still be a Cryptome.) . . . . . Ackerman reminds us about Project MKULTRA and the crazy acid tests that comprised America's war on commies until the '70s, when Congress' Church Commission put the kibosh on all that cloak-and-doctor intrigue. Even so, these two docs, dated from 1954 and 1955, are worth a good read. And they remind us that digital leak sites can do more than publicize the lifestyles of the Kazakhstani leadership. Pilot who posted video calls critics 'naive' By Kim Minugh The airline pilot now in the spotlight after he posted a cell phone video on the Internet criticizing airport security measures said today that his critics are "na&#239;ve" and ignoring a severe threat to the flying public. . . . Late last month, Liu, a pilot for American Airlines, posted a cell phone video on YouTube depicting what he perceives as a major security flaw involving ground crews and their easy access to the tarmac and parked planes. . . . Liu argues that ground crews are not screened by metal detectors or TSA personnel the way travelers or even airline employees are. Instead, they only have to swipe a card to access the tarmac. Make Mine a Manhattan By Tom Levenson It seems that an honorary member of the Crow tribe has just signed on with the Black Helicopter brigade and is readying&mdash;now, as I write, in some secure undisclosed location (Berchtesgaden?)&mdash;the documents of transfer that will (at last!) restore its traditional owners to their rightful enjoyment of just a tiny piece of American soil. That would be President Obama, getting ready to hand Manhattan back to the descendents of the Native Americans who first sold off the island to the Dutch. . . . Via Jillian Rayfield at TPM, we learn that the Obama administration&rsquo;s decision to reverse Bush era policy and support the U. N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People has so terrified folks that the usual suspects on the right are ginning up the reverb chamber to declare that yes, our Black, Kenyan, Muslim, Crow Usurper has taken the next step to obliterate liberty and subdue Americans terrified and ill-informed elderly white people under the yoke of&mdash;who is it this time? Oh yeah, Native Americans (getting in line after African American teenagers on buses, Muslims, Democrats and the Zerg Swarm).* Welcome to the "Hump Point" of this OND. News can be sobering and engrossing - at this point in the diary, an offering of brief escapism:  Random notes related to this video:  A few people seem to resent the disco nature of some of his latest work. To set the record straight, let it be known from the words of the man himself, "I was part of the generation that grew up with radio and rock&rsquo;n roll in the fifties. When I was 13, 14, 15 in Dallas there was a strong R&amp;B flavour to the music on the stations. It was an alternative to top 40." So, there you have it, kids. Back then the word disco didn&rsquo;t even exist. R&amp;B did. It just happened to be the music that Boz liked. Who&rsquo;d have guessed that the seventies would take R&amp;B, extract a few of its finer characteristics, mass produce it for the purpose of dancing and name it after the clubs where dancing is the attraction &#8211; discos. . . . if his voice has become an entity that overshadows his musicianship, it&rsquo;s natural. He is the voice of his music, the voice that&rsquo;s responsible for defining the Boz Scaggs sound. Because of Silk Degrees, lots of people can identify that sound. . . . "Lots of people manufacture music to be disco," Boz says in an effort to explain his stance, "I&rsquo;ve just happened to dig the rhythms all along. I think it&rsquo;s fun to use R&amp;B and disco to say something new and expressive. A couple of my songs might be disco in terms of their rhythmic and structural content but I think they&rsquo;re saying something more." . .   Back to what's happening: Environment and Greening Oil headed for $100 per barrel? By (UPI) U.S. market analysts are expecting crude oil to hit $100 per barrel, though some OPEC members said from Cairo that they weren't so sure. Oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange edged to more than $90 per barrel as U.S. inventories declined and winter weather created havoc for the transportation sector along the eastern seaboard. Key Wall Street investors such as Morgan Stanley are expecting oil to hit $100 per barrel in 2011. Meanwhile, gasoline prices, according to a former Shell executive, could hit $5 per gallon for U.S. consumers within a year. Cold manatees swim to warm power plant waters By (BBC) Manatees - large aquatic mammals sometimes called sea-cows - are fleeing the unseasonable cold in Gulf of Mexico for the warm waters of power plant discharge canals. More than 300 manatees swam into the outflow of Tampa Electric's Big Bend Power Station in Florida on Tuesday. Manatees cope poorly with cold conditions, which can affect their immune systems and lead to death. Science and Health Political allegiances linked to brain structure, study finds By (guardian.co.uk) An experiment has found differences between the brains of progressives and conservatives. Head scans of students at University College London, conducted by neuroscientist Geraint Rees, showed a "strong correlation" between thickness in two regions, the amygdala and the anterior cingulate, and political viewpoint. Finest Chocolate May Get Better: Cacao Tree Genome Sequenced By (ScienceDaily) The production of high quality chocolate, and the farmers who grow it, will benefit from the recent sequencing and assembly of the chocolate tree genome, according to an international team led by Claire Lanaud of CIRAD, France, with Mark Guiltinan of Penn State, and including scientists from 18 other institutions. . . . "Our analysis of the Criollo genome has uncovered the genetic basis of pathways leading to the most important quality traits of chocolate -- oil, flavonoid and terpene biosynthesis," said Siela Maximova, associate professor of horticulture, Penn State, and a member of the research team. "It has also led to the discovery of hundreds of genes potentially involved in pathogen resistance, all of which can be used to accelerate the development of elite varieties of cacao in the future." . . . Guiltinan and his colleagues are interested in specific gene families that could link to specific cocoa qualities or disease resistance. They hope that mapping these gene families will lead to a source of genes directly involved in variations in the plant that are useful for acceleration of plant breeding programs. Descent Yields to Ascent. Everyone Yields to Asshats. By Isis the Scientist . . . Meandering up the trail, I was reminded of a common bit of hiking etiquette - the descent always yields to ascent. &nbsp;If you are running or hiking down the mountain, you always allow people ascending to pass if you encounter a place where only one person can pass at a time. &nbsp;That doesn't mean that it happens this way. &nbsp;Hiking trails are full of iPod-wearing asshats, bounding down the trail, trying to beat their very best time by 0.01 seconds. &nbsp;Everything moves out of the way for asshats. &nbsp;But, the hike was not ruined by asshats. &nbsp;I moved over, allowed them to pass, and took a couple of quicker steps, and got back on pace. &nbsp;I also wondered to myself how many of them would catch their foot and tumble. . . . Here's the funny thing about respect in academia and mountain climbing - &nbsp;You can't really earn it. &nbsp;People are either going to give it to you or they aren't. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if you dress in the most elite trail hiking apparel, shave your chest, and wear your iPod in one ear, just like all of the other trail racers. &nbsp;When you come to the interface where one of you has to yield, not matter how much you look like that other person, a true asshat is not going to yield. &nbsp;It has nothing to do with you. &nbsp; It's about that person not valuing the world beyond the sphere of his own goals. The same is true in academia. &nbsp;I remember when I was in high school, I had a conversation with my mother. &nbsp;My mother was a licensed practical nurse and always had aspirations that I would go to medical school. &nbsp;She told me, "If you want to succeed and impress people, you are going to have to work twice as hard as the men do." &nbsp;I realize, looking back, what a load of smelly, bad advice that was. &nbsp;If a man doesn't respect you because you are a woman, the problem is not with you. &nbsp;The problem is with them. &nbsp;Working super hard isn't going to change their world view. &nbsp;You'll always be a woman and they will always view you within the sphere of achieving their own goals. It's not about you. &nbsp;It's about them. 'Living pigment' in rock art discovered By (UPI) Some examples of ancient rock art in Western Australia maintain their vivid colors because they are alive, researchers have found. Scientists at the University of Queensland have discovered that colorful bacteria and fungi have colonized the rock paintings, the BBC reported Monday. . . . These "living pigments" may explain why attempts to date some rock art have shown inconsistent results, Pettigrew says, because although the paintings may be ancient, the life that fills their outlines is quite recent. A Chemical Conundrum: How Dangerous Is Dioxin? By Jon Hamilton . . . Research in the 1980s and 1990s did a good job addressing the question of whether high-level exposures at places like Times Beach put people's health at risk, Cohen says. "I think we have the answer to that question, and the answer is yes." . . . But by the time this became clear, the agency was finding very low levels of dioxin all over the place &mdash; and it was coming from sources like people burning trash in their backyards. That created a whole new challenge for the agency, one it still is struggling to address. . . . "The dioxin report, when it's just printed out on a printer, is probably 2 1/2 feet tall," Gray says. "There are huge amounts of information here that have to be assembled, assimilated, integrated and somehow put together to tell a story that the agency can use to help inform decisions it has to make. And it's hard." 98.6 degrees F gives human perfect balance By (UPI) U.S. researchers say human body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit keeps metabolism up while keeping fungal growth down. . . . "This study helps to explain why mammalian temperatures are all around 37 degrees C," study co-author Dr. Arturo Casadevall says in a statement. This study is a good example of how mammalian evolution has been driven by both external biological factors and internal physiological constraints, study co-author Aviv Bergman adds. Technology Dating Sites Try Adaptive Matchmaking By Courtney Humphries . . . The online dating industry is bigger than ever. An estimated 40 million Americans are members of dating services offered over the Web or on mobile devices, and in China the number has grown to 140 million people. But matching up millions of members is a major technological challenge as well as an emotional one. While some sites simply let users browse for dates, many now offer some kind of system, if only to make suggestions. And companies in this competitive market are in hot pursuit of ways to make those suggestions more sophisticated and personalized. To do that, they are deploying machine-learning algorithms that are adapted from completely different types of online shopping. Joseph Essas, vice president of technology for eHarmony, was lured to the company from Yahoo three years ago. Since then, he has developed and implemented a new layer of predictive matching algorithms that are based on Yahoo's system for targeting advertising to specific users who have revealed preferences and behaviors over time. The matchmaking software gathers 600 data points for each user, including how often they log in, who they search for, and what characteristics are shared by the people they actually contact. . . . the new techniques are based not on questionnaires but on other kinds of "recommendation engines," like those used by Netflix and Amazon, says Gavin Potter, chief technology officer of IntroAnalytics, a company that develops software for both e-commerce and dating sites. In the future, it could work the other way, too: matchmaking algorithms may help improve other kinds of online commerce. While shopping for a book and shopping for love do have some things in common, says Potter, one difference is that dating recommendations are bidirectional. "The object you're recommending has got to be interested as well," he says. If every person were shown the 10 hottest people on the site, the system wouldn't work. Gigantic 1,500-Pound Camera Captures First X-Ray Images of Lightning By Rosa Golijan Some madly brilliant scientists recently used a gigantic 1,500-pound camera to capture x-ray images of lightning&mdash;which they triggered artificially using wires and rockets. Crazy? Maybe, but it's definitely a beautiful experiment. As a result of having a camera which could capture a lightning bolt traveling at one-sixth the speed of light, scientists have been able to discover that there's "a bright ball of x-rays at the head of the bolt, with almost no lingering radiation along the bolt's trail." &nbsp;. . London CCTV System Caught over 2,500 Criminals in 2010 By Shane McGlaun Citizens in London are used to the cameras that adorn street corners and other locations around the historic metropolitan area. The cameras are used to monitor citizens and help the police in London to solve crime as well. The cameras are very effective at solving crimes according to the London Metropolitan Police (Met). . . . The increase in the number of suspects identified may have to do with the increasing number of cameras in the city. In 1999, London had a CCTV system with 21,000 cameras installed. However, in 2010, the CCTV system has a total of 59,753 cameras. The Met also says that of all the 2,512 suspects that were caught this year using the camera system, many of them were violent offenders. . . . Neville did say that the modernization and growing complexity of the CCTV system in London had raised some issues though. The system moved from VHS tapes to digital video storage. With the move, getting the captured video takes a specialized officer and takes longer than retrieval did in the VHS days. The Met officer also says that the digital video isn&rsquo;t kept as long as tapes were. Michigan Man Charged with Felony for Seeking Adulterous Emails in Wife's Account By Tiffany Kaiser . . . Leon Walker, 33, a resident of Rochester Hills, Michigan and computer technician with Oakland County, could be sentenced up to five years in prison for a felony computer misuse charge, which is an Internet law made to protect against identity theft and stealing of trade secrets. Walker logged on to a laptop that both he and his then-wife, Clara Walker, had shared. Her password was supposedly saved in the Gmail login. What Walker had found was that Clara was allegedly cheating on him with a previous husband. . . . In an attempt to avoid any more possible domestic violence, and to protect the child from having to witness or be apart of it, Walker printed the emails and gave them to Clara's first husband. He then filed an emergency motion to obtain custody of the child. In February 2009, Walker was arrested for giving Clara's first husband the emails. Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper decided to charge Walker, calling him a skilled "hacker" who obtained the emails in a "contentious way." Breaking GSM With a $15 Phone ... Plus Smarts By John Borland Speaking at the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Congress here Tuesday, a pair of researchers demonstrated a start-to-finish means of eavesdropping on encrypted GSM cellphone calls and text messages, using only four sub-$15 telephones as network "sniffers," a laptop computer and a variety of open source software. While such capabilities have long been available to law enforcement with the resources to buy a powerful network-sniffing device for more than $50,000 (remember The Wire?), the pieced-together hack takes advantage of security flaws and shortcuts in the GSM network operators&rsquo; technology and operations to put the power within the reach of almost any motivated tech-savvy programmer. . . . Much of this vulnerability could be addressed relatively easily, Nohl said. Operators could make sure that their network routing information was not so simply available through the internet. They could implement the randomization of padding bytes in the system information exchange, making the encryption harder to break. They could certainly avoid recycling encryption keys between successive calls and SMSs. Cultural Secrets of an Ancient Tel Aviv Fortress Revealed By (ScienceDaily) Tel Qudadi, an ancient fortress located in the heart of Tel Aviv at the mouth of the Yarkon River, was first excavated more than 70 years ago -- but the final results of neither the excavations nor the finds were ever published. Now, research on Tel Qudadi by archaeologists at Tel Aviv University has unpeeled a new layer of history, indicating that there is much more to learn from the site, including evidence that links ancient Israel to the Greek island of Lesbos. . . . One of the key finds, say researchers, is an amphora (a large jar used to transport oil or wine) which hails from the Greek island of Lesbos. The existence of the artifact, together with a re-assessment of the local ceramic assemblage of Tel Qudadi, has helped researchers to re-calculate the timeline of the site's operation. Amazingly, it seems to be the earliest example of the Lesbian amphorae discovered so far in the Mediterranean, including the island of Lesbos itself. While a single find cannot prove the existence of trade between ancient Israel and Lesbos, the finding has much to say about the beginnings of the island's amphora production and has implications for understanding trade routes between different parts of the Mediterranean. . . . Now that the site can be dated from the late 8th -- early 7th centuries B.C.E., the fortress at Tel Qudadi may be considered an important intermediate station on the maritime route between Egypt and Phoenicia, serving the Assyrian interests in the Levantine coast rather than a part of the Israelite Kingdom. For Young Swiss Rebels, A Dark Chapter In History By Eric Westervelt . . . In the late 1960s, Zurich-born Ursula Biondi was 16 years old when she ran away to Italy with her 20-something boyfriend, after fighting with her parents. Biondi was pregnant when Italian authorities returned her, against her will, to Switzerland. . . . Biondi, then several months pregnant, says she sometimes worked 10 hours a day in the prison laundry alongside convicted murderers, thieves and drug offenders. At night, she was locked in a cell. . . . Biondi's father, a construction worker, had to scrape to come up with the 7,000 francs for the so-called tuition fee for what authorities called an "educational program" for his "promiscuous" daughter. Prison officials told Biondi her baby would be put up for adoption. Her mother soon demanded her daughter's release, and after a year, Biondi was reunited with her infant son and released from jail. Her tale is one of thousands suffered by Swiss youth subjected to administrative detention. It was a practice started in the 1880s and lasted until the early 1980s. Now, after decades of silence, many victims today are demanding accountability &mdash; and compensation for damaged lives. Rabbis' wives urge Israeli women: Stay away from Arab men By Chaim Levinson A letter urging Jewish women not to date non-Jewish men has been published by a group of rabbis' wives. The letter comes on the heels of a rabbis' letter published earlier this month urging Jews not to sell or rent properties to non-Jews. The new letter, signed by 30 rabbis' wives, says, "For your sake, for the sake of future generations, and so you don't undergo horrible suffering, we turn to you with a request, a plea, a prayer. Don't date non-Jews, don't work at places that non-Jews frequent, and don't do national service with non-Jews." . . . The group operates a shelter for women who leave their Arab partners and educate the public on what it calls the dangers that arise from contact between Jews and Arabs. The organization also called for the boycott of the Gush Etzion branch of the supermarket Rami Levi, where Arab and Jewish workers are on shift side-by-side. You can tell everybody, this is our son: Elton John becomes a father at 63 By Helen Pidd . . . Three months off that landmark birthday, Elton John might have partly retired from the pop music industry, but he is set to be busier than ever after becoming a father for the first time. . . . John has spoken in the past of his desire to become a father, announcing last autumn that he wanted to adopt a 14-month-old boy from an orphanage in Ukraine. He said then that the couple had always talked about adoption, but that he had objected because of his age. It was the death of his keyboard player, Guy Babylon, that helped to change his mind. Babylon, who died of a heart attack aged 52 last year, had two children whom John described as "wonderful". He said at the time: "What better opportunity to replace someone I lost than to replace him with someone I can give a future to?" . . . In some US states, including California, parents who have paid a surrogate can apply for a prebirth order. This means that they, and not the woman who carried the baby, will be listed on the birth certificate as parents, regardless of whose egg and sperm was used in conception. And in California, unlike in Britain, surrogates can be paid an unlimited fee.  Meteor Blades sometimes offers an Evening Open Diary.

	<author>Rimjob</author>
	<text>"Re-Imagining" Darth Vader..... It's sort of hard to un-forget something, but what if you tried? Over at The Swedish Bed, they have illustrations from artists who were given only the following passage from the original 'Star Wars' script and then used it to create a design for Darth Vader.      INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY. The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic.   I believe the actual design of Darth Vader is based on Marvel Comics' Doctor Doom.   </text>

	<title>New support site for 99ers.</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 09:26:15 PM PST</date>
	<author>sceptical observer</author>
	<text>New support site for 99ers. http://crooksandliars.com/...   The 99ers. That's the name given to the millions of people who lost their jobs during the Bush almost-a-depression-recession, and have now exhausted all of their unemployment benefits. President Obama "negotiated" a big deal just weeks ago that, I supposed, paved the way for the lame duck Congress to repeal DADT, give health care to the 9-11 first responders, pass a food safety bill and ratify the new START treaty. He agreed to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans in return for the big Republican concession -- a 13-month extension of unemployment benefits, something that they should have (and likely would have) agreed to anyway. But what most people don't realize is that the 13-month extension doesn't extend the benefits for the unemployed... it just allows the current unemployment benefits programs to continue operating, giving people benefits for up to a maximum of 99 weeks, for another 13 months. But if you're a "99er" -- if you've exhausted your benefits, you're likely feeling quite forgotten right now. From the Obama-GOP tax cut "compromise" to the very productive not-so-lame duck session of Congress, there was nothing for the 99ers. So, last week on the Randi Rhodes Show, we were talking about the plight of the 99ers, and people began calling in with their stories. I knew I needed to do something, though I'm not in much better shape than they are!  </text>

	<text>2010 worst year for bank failures since 1992  More banks failed in the United States this year than in any year since 1992, during the savings-and-loan crisis, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Amid high unemployment, a struggling economy and a still-devastated real estate market, the nation is closing out the year with 157 bank failures, up from 140 in 2009. As recently as 2006, before the bubble burst, there were none. http://www.washingtonpost.com/... </text>

The plastic money market continues, unabated. &nbsp;It defines our financial system. &nbsp;It will destroy our financial system.</text>

	<text>80-year-old Va R leads pot decrim fight  80-year-old Virginia Republican leads state&rsquo;s marijuana decriminalization fight Virginian lawmakers will have a unique opportunity to end criminal penalties for simple possession of marijuana in their state when the 2011 Virginian General Assembly Session convenes on Wednesday, January 12. Surprisingly enough, 80-year-old Republican Delegate Harvey Morgan, an assistant clinical professor of pharmacy at Virginia Commonwealth University, is leading the charge to decriminalize marijuana possession. Legislation proposed by Morgan, known as House Bill 1443, would replace the criminal fine for possession with a civil penalty and eliminate the 30-day jail sentence and criminal record that would follow conviction. The bill would not change penalties for the manufacture or distribution of marijuana. It would also continue to require drug screening and education for minors convicted of marijuana possession. http://www.rawstory.com/... </text>

	<text>Chris Matthews Chris Matthews, 'enemy of the birthers,' stumbles into debate about Obama's birth certificate  Chris Matthews has fumbled his way right into the debate over President Obama's birth certificate. The liberal MSNBC host -- while declaring the controversy over the President's birth certificate "nonsense" -- nonetheless asked on Monday night why Obama has not demanded the release of a copy of his full birth certificate. . . . "I am not a birther, I am an enemy of the birthers," Matthew said -- before offering up a comment that was reminiscent of the movement. "Why has the President himself not demanded that they put out the initial documents?" . . . "Don't we want to know if he can find it? I don't know why the governor doesn't say, 'Snap it up, whoever is there in the Department of Records, send me a copy right now,'" Matthews added. "And why doesn't the President just say, 'Send me a copy right now?'" http://www.nydailynews.com/...</text>

	<text>Thanks, wader!!! Best wishes to all here!!!! From story above:  Meandering up the trail, I was reminded of a common bit of hiking etiquette - the descent always yields to ascent. &nbsp;If you are running or hiking down the mountain, you always allow people ascending to pass if you encounter a place where only one person can pass at a time. &nbsp;That doesn't mean that it happens this way.   I know the story is about something else entirely, but it brought back a funny memory. &nbsp;Many, many years ago, at Easter, hubby and I were going up the walk to Clingman's Dome in the Appalachian Mountains (TN &amp; NC border). &nbsp;It had snowed 12 inches overnight and an attempt to shovel a tiny path had been made though it was covered still with snow and ice. It is almost straight up and down...a very steep path. Because we are from MI and know about the snowbelt of Ohio, we had brought boots and coats. &nbsp;We put them on to ascend and found people coming down the narrow, icy path in regular shoes (Not hiking boots or sneakers) and some ladies were in high heels. We stepped out into the snow, of course, which nearly covered our boots. &nbsp;It seemed like the right thing to do. But they looked at us and laughed as if we were the weird ones. &nbsp;lololol ~shrug~ It was a beautiful sight, too, from the top of the Dome with every tree wearing clumps of wet snow and a dark blue sky behind the pines. &nbsp; Of course, we had hoped for warm weather...sigh. My daughter and her family are headed there for a few days and I hope they do get at least into the 50's before they come home.</text>

	<author>zqxj</author>
	<text>Bailed-Out Banks Slip Toward Failure  http://online.wsj.com/... Nearly 100 U.S. banks that got bailout funds from the federal government show signs they are in jeopardy of failing. The total, based on an analysis of third-quarter financial results by The Wall Street Journal, is up from 86 in the second quarter, reflecting eroding capital levels, a pileup of bad loans and warnings from regulators. The 98 banks in shaky condition got more than $4.2 billion in infusions from the Treasury Department under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. . . . Seven TARP recipients have already failed, resulting in more than $2.7 billion in lost TARP funds. Most of the troubled TARP recipients are small, plagued by wayward lending programs from which they might not recover. The median size of the 98 banks was $439 million in assets as of Sept. 30. The median TARP infusion for each was $10 million, federal filings show.  </text>

	<text>culture & government http://www.whitehouse.gov/... Interesting first hand: Video http://www.newser.com/... http://www.esquire.com/... Man of Mystery - Harry Reid   Back in 1998, when he ran a terribly dysfunctional campaign and pulled out his reelection over John Ensign by just 428 votes after a month of lawsuits and missing ballots and psychic torture, Reid took up yoga. He says it's not so hard to do, you just have to sweat a lot in a hot room. But lately he hasn't had time for yoga or much else. And he's in another race that's just a killer, and what's worse, his opponent this time is crazy. The only real difference between '98 and now is that no one expected him to lose in '98, and no one expects him to win now. No one.    But it is disregard like this that has always propelled him. Back when he was in law school at George Washington and working full-time as a Capitol Hill cop, and Landra was pregnant with their second and his car died and the schedule was killing him, Reid went to one of the deans of the law school &mdash; fellow named Potts &mdash; to plead his case and ask for some financial assistance. And Potts came back at him with "Mr. Reid, maybe the law is not for you. Why don't you just quit?" Instead, Reid doubled his course load, finished law school early, and vowed to leave that miserable town and never go back. So he's got more than a little chip on his shoulder. Now everybody says that he is about to be swallowed by history, served up like a sacrifice. Many in the press say he ought to just capitulate to the power of this narrative and are actually impatient with Reid's noncooperation in the face of a tidal wave. Guy doesn't seem to understand. Could be because the paper in Vegas seems to hate him so much; it's enough to make one jaundiced by media narratives. "For the past eighteen months, they wrote two editorials a week against me," Reid says. "One Sunday, they ran five pieces of negative stuff plus a cartoon against me. As a journalist, that would have made Mike terribly upset."  </text>

	<title>CIA and hypnosis</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 10:31:00 PM PST</date>
	<author>subtropolis</author>
	<text>CIA and hypnosis I was just at cryptome last night reading those two PDFs. Search for "CIA: Hypnotism and Covert Operations" and "CIA: The Military Application of Hypnotism" on the front page. There's nothing earth-shattering in them, although they are interesting. It should be pointed out that these documents have been declassified, and so claiming that cryptome "exposed" this is stretching things a tad. Especially as it's no great secret that CIA has looked into hypnosis. There are also a couple of PDFs covering various OSS/CIA business that were quite a good read. For those who are unfamiliar with cryptome, it's a clearinghouse of information that, according to its proprietor John Young, wants to be free. Much of it has been declassified (although perhaps obscure) but some of it is genuinely leaked info. The site began with a focus mostly on cryptology but the scope has widened greatly to include just about everything. And, over the past several years or so, Young himself seems to have become a bit more &#8230; acerbic than before. Basically, there's likely something he's posted that might piss you off. But it's still always a pleasure to drop in from time to time.</text>

	<text>mind-control CIA http://www.wired.com/...  The agency&rsquo;s mind-control experts gave up some helpful tips, according to the 1955 memo. It&rsquo;s easier "to hypnotize large numbers of people" than individuals" &mdash; alas, there&rsquo;s no useful elaboration on that point &mdash; and in no circumstance can the hypnotizer fail to get a subject to snap out of his trance.    Still, responsible mind-control advocates could scarcely avoid presenting the potential drawbacks of their own courses of action. Since there&rsquo;s no rigorous scientific way of determining "what limits &lsquo;belief&rsquo; may be changed by hypnosis," that means a "double-think Orwellian world of hypnosis, while unlikely, is not utterly fantastic."    As it turns out, successful mind control could get out of hand rapidly. Who would have thought? The CIA&rsquo;s aborted experiments in hypnosis are long-documented. Its impulses to master the human mind led to the mass LSD tests called MK-ULTRA, which became the subject of acrimonious congressional inquiries.    And three years ago, the CIA&rsquo;s document dump of its so-called "Crown Jewels" of decades-old secrets went into further detail about its hypnotism fetish. But in case you find yourself unmoved by the disclosures, consider that you have no foolproof way to determine that you aren&rsquo;t yourself the subject of mental conditioning.   http://www.wired.com/...

	<text>Archive: Family Jewels - URL The entire "Family Jewels" file and related documents can be found at the website of the National Security Archive. http://www.gwu.edu/... http://www.thenation.com/...  Today, the CIA released its infamous "Family Jewels" file. This is a set of internal memos compiled in the mid-1970s after press reports revealed numerous CIA dirty tricks. In 1973, CIA director James Schlessinger, having learned that Watergate burglars E. Howard Hunt and James McCord (each a CIA veteran) had been in contact with the Agency while carrying out illegal activities for President Richard Nixon's reelection campaign, ordered divisions within the CIA to report any activities they had engaged in since 1959 that might be outside the CIA's authority. Deputy Director William Colby then assembled a loose-leaf notebook of the memos that poured in. The whole package totaled 700 pages. And though its existence has been known for years--congressional investigators of the 1970s had access to these documents--this secret file has never before been made public. It was considered to hold the agency's darkest secrets.  </text>

	<author>anyname</author>
	<text>80% intel budget controlled by Sec. of Defense  The CIA director has never had much power, and the new Director of National Intelligence, a position created in 2004, may have even less.    Follow the money: for decades, 80 percent of the intelligence budget has been controlled by the Secretary of Defense and most intelligence agencies are still housed in the Pentagon. Ever wonder why the Pentagon keeps trashing intelligence reform proposals?    Amy B.

	<title>"X-Ray Images of Lightning "</title>

	<author>subtropolis</author>
	<text>"X-Ray Images of Lightning " &gt; CLICK &lt; That got my attention. Didn't disappoint. Here's the National Geographic article that was cribbed from:  Lightning Captured by X-Ray Camera&mdash;A First Making a camera capable of taking such quick images was an achievement in and of itself, Dwyer emphasized. "You can't just go buy a camera and point it at lightning," he said. "We had to make it." The resulting 1,500-pound (680-kilogram) camera&mdash;created by Dwyer's graduate student Meagan Schaal&mdash;consists of an x-ray detector housed in a box about the size and shape of a refrigerator. The box is lined with lead to shield the x-ray detector from stray radiation. X-rays enter the box through a small hole that in turn focuses them, like an old-fashioned pinhole camera.  </text>

	<text>"importance is not synonymous with quality" Just found out the bad news that hollywood, always desperate to fuck up a classic, has gotten its greedy, clumsy hands on Gulliver's Travels now. It's not pretty. This excellent review spells it out.  Gulliver's Travels will make you seasick in the cineplex Imagine you're a kid who's watching the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Now imagine that some faceless interlocutor waltzes into your living room, stops the movie 40 minutes in, suddenly mutters, "Well, Augustus Gloop is dead. Poor bastard drowned in Nutella," and then makes you pay an inexplicable $8 sunglasses tax. You'd have no idea that Gene Wilder goes on a boat ride through William Burroughs' amygdala. You'd spend the rest of your life thinking the film was about the accidental death of a German child with juvenile diabetes.  </text>
