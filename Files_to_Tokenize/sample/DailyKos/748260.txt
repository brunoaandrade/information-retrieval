	<text>   I would call them werewolves myself, but at New Deal 2/0, as part of his series on “Breaking Through the Jobless Recovery,” economist William Lazonick writes How the SEC Let the Wolves into the Stock Market Chicken Coop: In 1991, well-known compensation consultant Graef S. Crystal published In Search of Excess: The Overcompensation of American Executives in response to an explosion in executive pay that occurred in the US in the 1970s and 1980s. How, Crystal asked, did it make any economic sense for the CEOs in his sample of 200 large US corporations to be making 130 times the pay of the average American worker? And why were they making about seven times the compensation of their CEO counterparts at Japanese companies, many of which were out-competing their US rivals? Yet the surge in top executive pay that Crystal observed 20 years ago pales in comparison to the volcanic eruption that has occurred since then. In the mid-2000s, top executive pay in the United States was about three times higher in real terms than the levels of the early 1990s. And the ratio of the average compensation of the CEOs of the largest corporations to that of the average worker climbed as high as 525:1 in 2000 before declining to what has become the “new normal” of about 350:1 in 2010. The gains from exercising stock options represent both the largest and most variable component of top executive pay, giving CEOs, CFOs, and other top dogs a huge interest in allocating corporate resources in ways that jack up their companies’ stock prices — most notably through stock buybacks that can run into billions of dollars per year. Large corporations use buybacks to manipulate the stock market. And the fact that top corporate executives can sell the shares that they acquire from exercising stock options without any delay means that, avoiding any risk, they can capitalize on the short swings in their company’s stock price that their corporate allocation decisions help to create. Nice work if you can get it! And guess how they got it? A gift of the regulator of US stock markets, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 1982 and 1991 the SEC - the US government agency which is supposed to protect stock-market investors from stock-price manipulation and short-swing profits by insiders — promulgated rule changes that gave the wolves free access to the chicken coop. ...   At Daily Kos on this date in 2009: That sound you hear is millions of Republican heads exploding simultaneously, as Michael Steele once again shoves his foot down his throat: That’s the mood the administration is beginning to take. You understand what the underlying principle of socialism is. It is government control of the means of production. In this case, it is the government controlling the means of providing health care to the American people. It is inserting itself into the very fabric of the decisions that you make, have to make every single day. It'll make the Terry Schiavo case look like a walk in the park. You know, you’re going to have meetings and committees, government agencies and bureaucrats making decisions on what kind of health care you get. Seriously, Michael, how much did the DNC pay you to equate the Republican Party's interference in Terri Schiavo's life with socialized medicine?   Top Comments can be found here.

	<text>I think I'll push this again, What can I say? I have good views. Since I think Last Week in Photos is a great view for the coming work week and an improved views are always a good thing, perhaps someone here can use a little relaxation. I write many photo diaries and some are better than others but most all have a political theme. This one was sort of like that Rachel Maddow commercial when she discusses what previous generations left for the next and &nbsp;then asks "What are we leaving for the children now?"  But I didn't want to knock anyone over the head with that message. Just wanted to show some pretty pictures. Photos that starts in Spanish Harlem and the East River and winds its way up the Hudson to the hills of Orange County. In Last Week in Photos, really more like four photo diaries than one, the gems are hidden in the bottom. You will find one of the prettiest &nbsp;drives in America and seven pristine lakes that are just a few miles from New York City.</text>

	<title>Gawker to sue Chris Christie (re: Roger Ailes)</title>
	<date>Sun Jul 24, 2011 at 08:33:00 PM PDT</date>
	<author>Trix</author>
	<text>Gawker to sue Chris Christie (re: Roger Ailes) Gawker, the popular blog based in New York, is going to court to investigate the relationship between the Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. [...] The lawsuit has its origins in a New York magazine story in May which reported that Mr. Ailes had called Mr. Christie and "encouraged him to jump into the race" for president earlier this year. The report piqued the attention of people like Mr. Cook who believe that Mr. Ailes, a former Republican strategist who has run Fox News since its founding in 1996, still has a hand in politics. Mr. Christie has repeatedly ruled out running for president in the current election cycle. In an interview with The Daily Beast weeks later, Mr. Ailes denied urging Mr. Christie to run, but acknowledged having dinner with him last summer. By then, Mr. Cook had already sent a request to Mr. Christie’s office for any letters, logs of phone calls or records of meetings between Mr. Ailes and Mr. Christie. Mr. Cook asserted that that communications trail should be available under the state’s open public records act, but in mid-June, Mr. Christie’s office said that the records, if they exist, would be exempt upon "executive privilege and well-settled case law." [...] The lawsuit to be filed on Monday states, "A strong public interest exists in knowing whether the executive in charge of the nation’s most-watched cable news channel is acting as a political consultant to a prospective Republican presidential candidate."  N.Y. Times Gawker/John Cook will be represented by the New Jersey chapter of the ACLU.</text>

	<text>Put that in perspective 1-Cable news is still dwarfed by network news. Faux 'News' is the classic big (and rotten) fish, in a smallish pond. 2-Bill O' Liely, Faux's top rated entertainer and side-show-geek is often tied and sometimes beaten in the cable ratings by Sponge Bob Square Pants. (Sponge Bob has more credibility.) 3-If news sources were ice cream parlors, Faux is the ONLY ice cream parlor in town selling cyanide and fresh bullshit laced ice cream (because the other ice cream parlors have at least SOME ethics.) In other words the other cable news shows sell all sorts of mostly generic flavors, and split the sane consumers of ice cream between them, &nbsp;but the only place the fans of that special brain-cell-killing cyanide tingle and rage inducing gut disturbances from all the bullshit is Faux "News"</text>

	<author>BruinKid</author>
	<text>Everyone should also read... what Charles Johnson has to say about the manifesto from the Norwegian right-wing terrorist Anders Breivik. &nbsp;Johnson probably knows these anti-Islam xenophobes better than anyone on this site. But I’ve seen a lot of people mistakenly attributing the articles that make up most of the manifesto to Breivik himself. In fact, the blog source that’s probably cited the most throughout Breivik’s book is Jihad Watch, run by anti-Muslim demagogue Robert Spencer; Breivik cites Robert Spencer more than 40 times, always approvingly. And a very large number — more than three dozen — of the lengthy articles reprinted in the book are the work of the anonymous white nationalist blogger “Fjordman,” who apparently gave Breivik permission to use them. Back in the day, I linked to Fjordman’s articles myself; he was a big self-promoter and would email and ask for links every time he posted something. But sometime around 2007 (when I criticized him and other “counter-jihad” bloggers for making deals with extreme right wing European groups) it became clear that his seeming erudition and extreme logorrhea was a cover for a particularly nasty form of European white nationalism. .... Just look at what these people are saying to their right wing fans; if you follow this stuff to its sickening logical conclusion, the very fate of civilization itself is at risk. It’s an apocalyptic view, a vision of a war for existence against the encroaching dark-skinned hordes. Among people who truly believe this paranoid world view, is it any wonder that one of them finally took the next step? .... People like Fjordman and Pamela Geller and the right wing blogosphere who spew apocalyptic rhetoric and refuse to denounce the extremists among them now have the very real blood of children on their hands. </text>

	<text>as I noted in a comment thread about the manifesto earlier, it's not as if any of these ideas expressed in the thing are exactly new and fresh: scapegoating the exotic other is a well-worn tenet for coping with a situation you don't want to face. &nbsp;it isn't a great leap to go from the scapegoating to the eliminating, and that's not exactly a new idea either.</text>

	<text>Wall Street better party while they still can The whole world financial fiasco has given new strength to efforts to regulate finance at the international level. &nbsp;The WTO tried to gain the authority to regulate finance as part of its Dohan Process, but that fell apart because of unrelated arguments over agricultural subsidies. It's an absolute certainty they'll try again. Once WTO gets that authority, Wall Street's party will be over---the international economic structure will take whatever steps it has to in order to insure the stability of the world financial structure and to prevent local collapses from pulling the entire system down into ruins. I'm betting Wall Street will not like those efforts. WTO has no sense of humor whatsoever, nor does it give a flying fuck for any nation's particular interests.</text>

	<author>Jeff Y</author>
	<text>This whole debt ceiling nonsense is all part of the Repugs grand plans to tank the US economy so they can defeat Obama in 2012. Every once in awhile when they let down their guard they even admit as much in public (Mitch McConnell, Jim Demint). I look for the entire 2012 presidential election to be like Florida during the 2000 presidential election, when the Repugs stole Florida and the election. There are so many crazy Teabagger governors in the country now (Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc) that I have no doubt whatsoever that we're going to see some weird "results". And just like Florida in 2000, by the time people figure out the election was stolen and how it was done, it will already be too late.</text>

	<text>It's a safe bet WTO will impose all sorts of requirements on every member government----how much debt they can run up, what steps they have to take to control inflation, setting uniform tax policies, maybe even regulating currency exchange rates. There's even been some talk about a uniform international tax rate. They'll do whatever they find necessary to protect the global system--in their minds the integrity of the global system is far more important than the needs or wants of any government. It may provoke one hell of a fight.</text>

	<text>Wish people would agree to limit CEO comp. It would give me some confidence in the U.S. market again if CEO pay (total compensation) had some caps, something like 40 times minimum wage, max of 100 times minimum wage. &nbsp;I'll bet they wouldn't oppose worker pay increases so much if that was the case and stockholders would get more return on investment. &nbsp;As it is, I won't touch the U.S. stock market these days as it seems to operate more as giant profit skimming operation than as an investment vehicle. &nbsp;Transparency is still non-existent. &nbsp; I had hoped there would be some housecleaning and re-regulating when Obama was elected. &nbsp;Hasn't happened. &nbsp;</text>

	<text>I wish they'd limit stock dividend payouts The CEOs aren't the company owners--they're just hired hacks, just plain ole employees no different in principle than the janitors. &nbsp;At least they do something resembling work for their money. The stockholders who own the companies, however, do absolutely nothing at all to earn it. They make no decisions, they make no product, they do nothing but "own" for a living. So if we're gonna limit CEO pay, let's also limit the amount of money going to the useless parasites, too.</text>

	<text>Uh...in theory stockholders do own the company I haven't seen problems with dividends other than they are so small in most cases that it makes little sense to invest with the risk of losing it all. &nbsp;And with "employees" of the exec team colluding with the board to loot the entity at stock holder and actual employee expense you won't find me defending our corporatist overlords. &nbsp;Problem is shareholders don't really have any power. Basic idea is supposed to be that as a shareholder you put your money in and it is at stake with a potential return. &nbsp;The company gets the funds it needs to survive, expand, make acquisitions, retire debt, whatever when it issues stock. &nbsp; So the funny thing is, the Execs have done well, while we shareholders often got our clocks cleaned (back when I was holding shares.) The stockholders you are calling "useless parasites" are often pension plans, individuals, and employees. &nbsp; That's an awfully broad brush stroke.</text>

	<author>Lenny Flank</author>
	<text>you are under a misconception The ownership of stock is heavily centralized in the US. It is simply not true that stock ownership is diffused amongst 401k's, IRA's, employee stock ownership plans, or pension funds. Those are only a minority of stock shares. (How many corporations do you know where the controlling stock interest is a pension fund?) The super-rich don't live on job income. &nbsp;Many of them don't even HAVE a job--they don't NEED to work for a living, dahling. They live on what the IRS calls, with wonderful honesty, "unearned income"----mostly stock dividends. That's why the biggest 5% of stock-holders own more than half of all stock shares---and it's not in the form of pensions or 401k's. Nor are we talking about Grandma who has a dozen shares of GM that she bought back in 1942. The major stockholders are parasites, pure and simple. As for "stock shares fund the company", it's simply not true. &nbsp;Virtually no company finances itself by stock issues---the big boys all finance themselves out of profits.</text>

	<author>Celtic Pugilist</author>
	<text>That's simply not true I didn't say what you have put in quotes. &nbsp;They finance themselves a variety of ways and issuing stock is one of them. &nbsp;Dilution from stock grants is one example...and at some companies that is a percent of employee compensation. &nbsp;But in theory the stockholder is an owner...even if they are an unsecured creditor. In fact, the opposite of what you state has been too common: &nbsp;I've seen major owners/founders shedding interest in the company through an offering in order to siphon money from new small investors. &nbsp;They walk away with money...and the investor gets fleeced along with other stockholders. But a bigger problem with your theory is that the vast majority of the wealth in the country is held by a few, so those pension plans, and employees, and small investors may only hold a small share, but they are are still directly important to tens of millions' financial security. &nbsp;With other investments having virtually no return there isn't much reason to invest anywhere anymore. &nbsp;But go ahead and saw another leg off, while Obama gnaws at the safety net. It's probably preferable for the U.S. if they pay dividends. &nbsp;If I'm not mistaken that gets taxed at a higher rate than capital gains. &nbsp;It certainly seemed to on my taxes back when I had outside investment income. &nbsp;I've been under the impression that this is why dividends got so sparse, and why some companies operate on the idea of rolling all profits back in assuming price appreciation. &nbsp;And capital gains frequently are not taken because of the companies going bust, etc. &nbsp;(See about 3 or 4 trillion $ on the Nasdaq last decade.) &nbsp; &nbsp;I'll take the bird in the hand over two in the bush when it comes to tax revenue.</text>

	<text>Thank you. The little savings we have were earning less than inflation. And mutual funds were eating me up with fees. So I've put our small savings into dividend paying stocks. Nice stable stocks. &nbsp;No, I don't work for any of these companies, never have. But we do work, and work hard. We are 25-30 years from retirement if we get lucky. So no, we won't be entitled to our "entitlements" when we get there. Companies that pay dividends do so for specific business purposes. Those of us who invest in these companies choose them over (usually) higher growth companies. &nbsp;They're reinvested and hopefully, our savings grow. This is our retirement, as you point out, and we truly believe it's all we will have when we are seniors. As gen-x'ers, we're used to the fact that there's just not much there for us when the Boomers are done. From jobs when we graduated college to homes when we got married, there's always been a shortage. So can we just keep our 40 cent dividends?</text>

	<title>Bycatch.</title>
	<date>Mon Jul 25, 2011 at 12:08:20 AM PDT</date>
	<author>grover</author>
	<text>Bycatch. You want to limit dividend payments to the super rich. How? If you do so through the tax code, you create another targeted law inserted into the patchwork of laws, which makes the tax code even more onerous, with the likelihood of bycatch more likely (AMT anyone?), and where some brilliant tax CPAs will likely find loopholes anyhow. If you plan to do so via statute, perhaps via the SEC, that dividend payments can only be dispersed to shareholders up to a certain dollar amount, (or perhaps only to shareholders with a net worth of less than $X million?), you would cause a total disruption of the market. Either the superrich would quickly diverst themselves of those holdings, or the would create multiple holding companies (which I presume &nbsp;you'd ban too), or they'd gift them to family members and friends as proxy owners (and hold their stocks in return). Or if this justs too chaotic, the corporations would say screw it and stop issuing dividend payments. And once again, you have bycatch. The problem with dividends (and with CEO pay) is that we don't tax the affluent, the rich and especially the superrich enough. Let them earn all the salary and income they can. But they need to pay appropriate taxes.</text>

	<text>I'm good with the first part in theory. I think there should be some minimum. Otherwise, I could buy one stock in every company in the S&amp;P500 just to wreak havoc.And what in the world would we do with daytraders that bounce in and out of stocks for no reason other than to make 35 cents per share for the day? &nbsp;A minimum investment (maybe 20 stocks over a minimum of 90 days) at least shows a commitment to that company. But the second part? I think we owe it to the employees of a company, the founding families, and communities in which these corporations are based to only allow shareholders who have a vested interest in the corporations -- that is, a buy-in. Otherwise, what's to keep un-vested members of society from voting to liquidate every corporation for their own benefit? Free cash? I think a lot of people would gladly obliterate perfectly good corporations that they have no affinity with just to get their hands on it.</text>

Indirect ownership through mutual funds dilutes the actual small shareholder's influence to even more microscopic (alright quantum) levels. &nbsp; Boards and execs set their own pay, not shareholders. &nbsp;That's a major reason I no longer hold shares. Shareholders don't really have an opportunity to stop excessive compensation. &nbsp;That is why the system is broken. &nbsp;Shareholders are the third wheel to the incestuous board/management relationships. &nbsp;Did you miss the whole options backdating scandal from last decade? &nbsp;There were at least 130 companies caught in that.</text>

	<text>you are right--despite all the happy talk from the corporate apologists, the vast number of stockholders are not "owners" in any realistic sense, they do not get their money because of their business knowledge or business decisions or business talent, and most of them have no say whatsoever in how the company is run. &nbsp;It's all bullshit. For most small stockholders, it's just a casino where you bet your money and hope you win. &nbsp;And for the tiny minority of Americans who actually hold the controlling shares of stock, it's just a way to make money without actually doing anything for it. They take your money, use it to make even more for themselves, then hand you a little piece of it back and say "thanks". They're parasites. &nbsp;Nothing more. Economically, they do nothing at all to justify their existence.</text>

	<text>Going through my old diaries tonight... ...and found the liveblog from the April 27th Alabama tornado outbreak. Got a lump in my throat reading the updates in chronological order. Ugh. &nbsp;I was in autopilot mode most of the day while posting radars/warnings about the tornadoes, but the immensity of the situation hit me like a ton of bricks when the Skycams/traffic cams caught the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham tornado live. I didn't sleep that night. We've got to do something, either through improved technology, improved warnings, improved building codes, or a strong mix of all three, to make sure that this year's death toll of 537 never happens again. The last time we saw deaths like this was in the 1920s, and due to modern technology and warning systems, we never thought it was possible again. For as much advanced equipment and warning capabilites we have, it doesn't matter if a 500-home neighborhood is hit by an EF-5 tornado and none of the homes are equipped to survive such a disaster. I don't know what it would take, but we need to do something -- anything -- to make sure we never see such a deadly tornado season again. [/rant]</text>

	<text>Michael Steele is useless MSNBC wallpaper He's jovial, but let's face it. He's being paid to be a political analyst and all we get out of him is a straight down the line Republican talking points memo. Hell, if he'd delivered that well for the Republicans as Chairman, he'd still be there. I'm not objecting to Steele finding work - or the idea of someone not out of the liberal mold as a commentator. In fact, it can be useful. But it is not useful to just hear the same old shit we hear from the currently employed GOP hacks.</text>

	<title>The rich need the tax break for jets, its summer</title>

	<author>foggycity</author>
	<text>The rich need the tax break for jets, its summer camp time and they have to jet the kids to Maine for camp you see. The one day trip so beats the hell out of the two days in the old limo. Can't say I'd mind that if i had $3,800 to fork over to charter a jet, they are doing it in droves(oh not you or me silly poor folks, the rich with the tax breaks and in large numbers). Here you go, your kid can't get oa job after college(if he/she) went, and we are suppose to stand by while Boner hands these Charter flying families going to $10,000 summer camps the funds they have taken from the middle class, the poor and programs that work to keep this country strong and healthy. But &nbsp;why complain? Its summer, what else do you have to do, its not like you have a jet to catch to deliver your kids to a $10,000 summer camp. No money for college? No job? “Love it, love it, love it,” Mr. LePage said of the private-plane traffic generated by summer camps...... Now, even as the economy limps along, more of the nation’s wealthier families are cutting out the car ride and chartering planes to fly to summer camps. One private jet broker, Todd Rome of Blue Star Jets, said his summer-camp business had jumped 30 percent over the last year. This weekend, a popular choice for visiting day at camps, private planes jammed the runways at small rural airports. Officials at the airport in Augusta said 51 private planes arrived between Thursday and Saturday; on a normal day, they would expect just a few. The airport was so busy that one of its two public runways was closed so all the incoming planes would have someplace to park, said Dale Kilmer, operations manager for Maine Instrument Flight, which operates the airport.   http://www.nytimes.com/...</text>

	<author>noweasels</author>
	<text>Murdoch's broadcasting license in UK in jeopardy After his testimony in Parliament was challenged by two former senior employees and referred by a lawmaker to Scotland Yard for investigation, James Murdoch has come under rising pressure in Britain’s phone hacking scandal that is likely to intensify this week. The board of British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster of which Mr. Murdoch is chairman, convenes on Thursday for the first time since the scandal erupted, as regulators continue their inquiry into whether the hacking scandal means the broadcaster should continue to be considered “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license. A day later, members of the parliamentary committee investigating the scandal are to meet to consider whether to ask for more information from Mr. Murdoch and whether to call him and former executives back in front of them to answer additional questions.
