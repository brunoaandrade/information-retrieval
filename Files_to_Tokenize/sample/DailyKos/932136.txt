	<text>  Months before Markos Moulitsas was banned from appearing on MSNBC, or Keith Olbermann was put on "indefinite unpaid suspension," or Joe Scarborough was treated to a couple of extra Thanksgiving week days off dutifully "suspended without pay" for his own campaign donations, a small blurb appeared in The New York Observer:    Inside the CNN Stockroom: Network Recently Shot Pilot Starring MSNBC's Shuster and NPR's Martin By Felix Gillette April 2, 2010 | 8:48 a.m. ~snip~ Recently, according to CNN sources, the network's in-house team shot a pilot for a news show featuring David Shuster of MSNBC and Michel Martin of NPR as co-anchors. ~snip~ Reached on Wednesday night, Ms. Martin declined to comment. Ditto Mr. Shuster. Ditto CNN.   That it even merited a blurb may have been evidence of an especially slow news day at 8:48 A.M. EST that day, but by 2:26 P.M, all hell had broken loose, at least for David Shuster and the wags in the DC media circuit. more over the fold...    April 2, 2010, 2:26 pm Shuster&rsquo;s CNN Dalliance May Bring MSNBC Response By BRIAN STELTER David Shuster, an anchor on MSNBC, recently participated in a test of a new show. But not for his own network. MSNBC executives were highly displeased when they learned about his test for the competing news channel CNN through a New York Observer article Friday morning, and they are now contemplating their response. "If true, this is unacceptable and David will be punished appropriately," an MSNBC spokesman, Jeremy Gaines, said Friday afternoon.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [emphasis mine] I found the words "will be punished" to be curiously draconian in tone, &nbsp;but this would not be Shuster's first suspension, if that was to be the verdict. &nbsp;Maybe they'd just fire him and let him move on to CNN, or someplace where he was more appreciated, I thought. In case anyone's forgotten what there was to appreciate about David Shuster, here's one example, out of many. &nbsp; In this segment, Shuster grills PUMAs with special sauce.  What I was not expecting to see was a petulant President of MSNBC, Phil Griffin, viciously attempt to destroy the career of an emmy award winning journalist by slandering and effectively binding and silencing him. Like any old fart with too much time on his hands, I, of course, sprang into action by starting a PhaseBook Group in search of like-minded outraged news junkies. &nbsp;We called it Punish David Shuster With His Own Show! and we started documenting and agitating for our "cause." At the time, I had about 4 friends on PhaseBook, and didn't even know how to navigate it. &nbsp;I checked out David Shuster's suddenly dormant page, and was stunned when, within moments, he accepted my "friend" request. &nbsp; Phil Griffin inadvertently gave our fledgling group a boost when he responded via email to an irate Shuster supporter that David was not "Moral, Ethical, or Professional." &nbsp;We were able to get our virtual hands on the email and had the recipient validate it for other media outlets. We started an online petition and sent a hard copy of it to Griffin, who rejected it and it was returned unopened. There were a couple of diaries here, but there seemed little interest in rocking the boat at the cable home of progressive stalwarts like Rachel Maddow, Ed Schultz and Keith Olbermann before Markos was banned and KO himself was unfairly suspended. Meanwhile, the right wing blogs and media piled on, as Griffin left Shuster twisting in the wind. David Shuster himself used his down time to return to school to complete his masters in public policy, attend to pressing personal issues, and work on developing new venues for his return to broadcast journalism. Late Monday night David Shuster was finally able to break his long silence and tweeted:  Tonight marks his return to broadcasting to substitute host the Jim Bohannan Show, which will be streamed live, here between 10:00p.m. and 1:00a.m. EST. And NO! &nbsp;Jim Bohannan will not be there, only David, to take your calls. Considering how long David has been muzzled, I'm perfectly willing to allow that even Jim Bohannan's show looks "terrific" about now. &nbsp;To the best of my knowledge, he is still not able to return to cable news until after his MSNBC contract expires Dec. 31st. The ever gracious Shuster was kind enough to take a few questions from me in advance, via email, to share with the DKos community.  sgary:  &nbsp;You are highly regarded by many for your assertive interviewing style and as someone who has usually done his homework. &nbsp;Will you be able to bring any of that to bear in your new, as yet unannounced &nbsp;mystery job? DS: &nbsp;You are very kind. &nbsp;The new venture will definitely reflect an "assertive" and "well prepared/researched" approach. &nbsp;I know that it can seem impolite to point out a lawmaker's hypocrisy or interrupt him/her when they mislead on the facts. &nbsp;But, that's my style...and it will be reflected in the journalism I'm responsible for in 2011. &nbsp; sgary: &nbsp;You've aggressively engaged some of the subjects of your stories, and had sharp exchanges via Twitter, FB, etc. &nbsp;You obviously had to walk a thin line while the MSNBC situation played itself out. &nbsp;What was that like for you personally? DS: &nbsp;When newsmakers are using social media to communicate and won't return phone calls or e-mails seeking comment on a story, it's appropriate to use social media to try and reach them. &nbsp;I always start with a phone call or e-mail... and reaching a newsmaker privately is my preference. &nbsp;But social media is one of the items in the toolbox. &nbsp;Furthermore, twitter is a great way to draw attention to stories and videos. &nbsp;As for MSNBC's view, I respected management's wishes and didn't take it personally. &nbsp; sgary: &nbsp; &nbsp;Is the DC press corp cliquish, and do you think that inhibits fearless journalism? DS: &nbsp;Every group has it's cliques, including the DC press corps. &nbsp;I think the larger challenge involves the sometimes delicate balancing act between getting "access" to newsmakers and holding these officials' feet to the fire. &nbsp;Many journalists in DC are most concerned about staying competitive on the day to day non investigative news and/or fear the possibility of losing a high profile interview to a competing organization. &nbsp; It's an institutional problem in DC...but it isn't insurmountable. &nbsp; &nbsp; sgary: &nbsp;What is your take on the state of cable news today and what do you see as the future of investigative journalism ? DS: &nbsp;Cable news can be fun and entertaining. &nbsp;But the future of investigative journalism belongs with agressive gum shoe reporters who can spend time developing sources, cultivating contacts, chasing down leads, examining documents, and etc. &nbsp;That's generally not the business model for cable news. &nbsp;And yet credible investigative reporting, even if it starts on the net, can have a ricochet effect and quickly influence the analysis and content of broadcast and cable news. &nbsp; sgary: Are there any specific important stories out there that you think are not being covered adequately? &nbsp;  DS: &nbsp;Karl Rove's connection to influence/money on the political right has intrigued me. But, the links between money and politics in general could use some more coverage. &nbsp;  sgary: &nbsp;Do you know who outted you for your CNN pilot? DS: &nbsp;I have no idea. &nbsp;All I know is that the story in the NY Observer said "CNN Sources." &nbsp;All things happen for a reason, though...and the incredible opportunity I have in 2011 might not have been there if hadn't been for my path in 2010. &nbsp;So I don't harbor any bitterness, regret, or ill feelings. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sgary: &nbsp;You have said your new venture will "have a huge impact on political journalism." &nbsp;Can you elaborate?  DS: &nbsp;I can't elaborate just yet... but when people see what we roll out, I think it will be clear. &nbsp;So, stay tuned! &nbsp;  I definitely will stay tuned, because Shuster assures me the new project will be of major interest to progressive news junkies like myself. You can ask David Shuster your own questions between 10 p.m.-1 a.m. by calling him live on air at 1-866-505-4626. </text>

We had high employment, decreasing poverty levels. His polices benefited to poor and middle class.</text>

	<author>Ralphdog</author>
	<text>Clinton only good compared to Reagan/Bush. Clinton only looked good when compared to the catastrophic policies of Reagan and Bush II. After the health care reform debacle, he almost immediately cast his lot in with business and against labor. His major accomplishments other than balancing the budget boil down to a DLC/Big Business wet dream. He rammed NAFTA through Congress over the bitter opposition of organized labor, and did nothing to reverse Big Business's war on labor. He validated attacks on teachers unions, gutted welfare, dismantled Depression-era banking regulations (with disastrous effects that are now all too obvious), and put Rob Rubin in charge of the economy. Under Clinton working class incomes rose slightly...and incomes for the plutocrats continued their surge into the stratosphere.</text>

	<title>Wrong. He Ran a Half Dozen Reagan Bubble Economy</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 05:48:48 AM PST</date>
	<author>Gooserock</author>
	<text>Wrong. He Ran a Half Dozen Reagan Bubble Economy which calculated even right after he left --before the crash corrected the bubbles-- left the BOTTOM 99% gaining no net worth. Only the top 1% gained, and almost all the gain went to the top couple thousand individuals.  He moved jobs offshore, destroyed the remains of journalistic press with media consolidation and gave us the financial trainwreck of W. But that only moved the wreck sooner. Under Clinton's economy we would be here later but it'd still be right where we are now. Clinton's housing bubble surpassed 100 year peaks when he was being impeached. It was blowing off the chart by the time he left office. Sure it was worse under W but it was already eating all and more of the supposed gains for the entire bottom 90% of the economy by then.  His economy and the seeming benefits to the poor and middle class were temporary, fake and utterly unsustainable. But he did balance the federal budget.</text>

	<text>I am no Hillary supporter.... far from it.... But I have to agree with you that they (journalists) are at their best when they dont go gaga for one player (Obama) and play too hard against the opposition (Hillary). They need to treat them all with a distanced, hard hitting, clear eyed view. Alas, them dayz aint these days. I did see that favoritism play out often on MSNBC and Obama certainly isnt much different from what we'd get from ClintonCentral. (Witness the Big Dog's recent podium rah rah for tax cuts for the wealthy as "hostage" saving deal by Obama admin.) Clinton and Obama are both establishment safe bets (you want to see a real media takedown, you dial back to Dean, 2004) but some on MSNBC hyped Obama as Golden Boy and Hillary as Bad Girl quite often... Keith did some over the top Special Comment rant against her that was a hyperbolic joke. Then there was Matthews with his tingle and Nora with her dewey eyes (when Obama was in her line of vision)... and many, many other examples. &nbsp;</text>

	<text>hmmm... Maybe CNN will put Wolf "Red Alert" Blitzer out to pasture and replace him with Schuster. (I call Wolf "Red Alert" because he treats every story, from a cat stuck in a tree to major disasters in the same way- as if the world is ending.)</text>

	<text>Hot tip for investigative skills!! I am impressed... and regards to this:  Like any old fart with too much time on his hands, I, of course, sprang into action by starting a PhaseBook Group in search of like-minded outraged news junkies. &nbsp;We called it Punish David Shuster With His Own Show! and we started documenting and agitating for our "cause."   let me say on behalf of "old farts" everywhere, Good Job there on taking the initiative and making something happen ;D</text>

	<title>What I found most interesting and annoying was</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 04:26:33 AM PST</date>
	<author>dkmich</author>
	<text>What I found most interesting and annoying was the statement by &nbsp;Hillary about putting our nation back on the road to prosperity .  Corporate profits are up. Stock prices are up. So why isn't anyone hiring? Actually, many American companies are &#8211; just maybe not in your town. They're hiring overseas, where sales are surging and the pipeline of orders is fat. More than half of the 15,000 people that Caterpillar Inc. has hired this year were outside the U.S. UPS is also hiring at a faster clip overseas. For both companies, sales in international markets are growing at least twice as fast as domestically. The trend helps explain why unemployment remains high in the United States, edging up to 9.8 percent last month, even though companies are performing well: All but 4 percent of the top 500 U.S. corporations reported profits this year, and the stock market is close to its highest point since the 2008 financial meltdown. But the jobs are going elsewhere. The Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, says American companies have created 1.4 million jobs overseas this year, compared with less than 1 million in the U.S. The additional 1.4 million jobs would have lowered the U.S. unemployment rate to 8.9 percent, says Robert Scott, the institute's senior international economist. "There's a huge difference between what is good for American companies versus what is good for the American economy," says Scott. American jobs have been moving overseas for more than two decades. In recent years, though, those jobs have become more sophisticated &#8211; think semiconductors and software, not toys and clothes.   Bill Clinton screwed us over, and here's hoping Shuster will put Democrats' feet to the fire on their dismal failure to stop our jobs from leaving and to bring our jobs home. &nbsp;</text>

	<text>where are the jobs? BUSH: SENDING JOBS OVERSEAS HELPS U.S. February 10, 2004 WASHINGTON &mdash; The movement of American factory jobs and white-collar work to other countries is part of a positive transformation that will enrich the U.S. economy over time, even if it causes short-term pain and dislocation, the Bush administration said yesterday. The embrace of foreign "outsourcing," an accelerating trend that has contributed to U.S. job losses in recent years and has become an issue in the 2004 elections, is contained in the president's annual report to Congress on the U.S. economy. http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/...</text>

	<title>Was just thinking about DS lately....</title>
	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 05:04:30 AM PST</date>
	<author>NYCee</author>
	<text>Was just thinking about DS lately.... Good to hear he is coming back. As for a clip on why he was so needed (I mean in the fools real journalists go where angels fear to tread" category) my personal fave was when he took Scarborough to task, tenaciously, morally, rightly... on the issue of torture. Our govt's sanctified torture. Of Iraqi and Afghan prisoners. Remember, some have been murdered. Remember, Obama never released those photos, after flipping away from a previous decision to do so, early in his term. It was on Morning Joe. Scarborough was on a roll. He couldnt have been more revolting as he mocked and belittled the "damage" (his scare quotes) done by the various tortures listed, including waterboarding. David Shuster gave it right back at him. Again and again. He stood up against torture and for ethical human behavior, our govt's rep be damned.  Joe is used to being yessed to death by his regulars, or given a milquetoasty blithering non argument "argument" at times by Mika, or a very gingerly worded snip of disagreement from the others when he goes way over the line. But never the sort of fierce debate Shuster waged with him. Joe just kept digging that ditch... Shuster rose above the bullshit... So bravo for that David Shuster! Remember that that is where you SHINE and may you shine that light again and again in the days ahead, back in the media spotlight. See, that's the problem with too many in the corporate media. They think the spotlight is supposed to shine on THEM... rather than the stories, the stories that MATTER. Again, chapeaux!</text>

	<date>Wed Dec 29, 2010 at 06:12:04 AM PST</date>
	<author>NYCee</author>
	<text>You wouldnt "overly clutter" w/such revelations! Or clutter to any degree whatsoever. See, they under clutter to the point of spartan, no, to the point of practically nil, sometimes actual nil, when it comes to this sort of viewpoint (Shuster's) expressed on torture, the oligarchy's destruction of the middle class, illegal wars by American presidents (join the queue, victims of said wars... not that you'll get any recompense, never mind a lousy apology!) Therefore, it is certainly not cluttering of any sort to add several examples of what is so fiercely prevented from seeing the light of day... ie, the pathetic, ugly, hypocritcal truth. Please, "clutter" freely and often! (And thanks for adding the clip... I tried but embed had html errors I couldnt get around... )</text>
