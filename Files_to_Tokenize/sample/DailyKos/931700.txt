	<text>   For What It&#8217;s Worth Paranoia strikes deep Into your life it will creep It starts when you're always afraid You step out of line, the man come and take you away Buffalo Springfield   Definition Paranoia is an unfounded or exaggerated distrust of others, sometimes reaching delusional proportions. Paranoid individuals constantly suspect the motives of those around them, and believe that certain individuals, or people in general, are "out to get them." http://medical-dictionary.thefreedic...   I have to admit during the Bush Administration I was afraid to say what I really thought of Dick Cheney to anyone but people I&#8217;d known for at least twenty years. It was mostly the Patriot Act that increased my paranoia. I had thought of myself as an ordinary opinionated American who liked to exercise their First Amedment rights up to that point, but reading the PA gave me the chills. &nbsp;After all, the Bush Administration didn&#8217;t get the Patriot Act passed for nothing. It would be a shame to waste all that power. &nbsp;It never hurts to remind ourselves:  The Act dramatically reduced restrictions on law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eased restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expanded the Secretary of the Treasury&#8217;s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadened the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act&#8217;s expanded law enforcement powers can be applied. The Act was passed by wide margins in both houses of Congress and was supported by members of both the Republican and Democratic parties. Opponents of the law have criticized its authorization of indefinite detentions of immigrants; searches through which law enforcement officers search a home or business without the owner&#8217;s or the occupant&#8217;s permission or knowledge; the expanded use of National Security Letters, which allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to search telephone, e-mail, and financial records without a court order; and the expanded access of law enforcement agencies to business records, including library and financial records.   http://en.wikipedia.org/... I&#8217;ve been slowly coming out of my shell, even posting my comments here on the Daily Kos, which I have never in my life done before (gone public on the internet, although I bought an Apple 2 in 1983 and have had a computer since). &nbsp;I wonder if that&#8217;s a good thing. &nbsp;I find my paranoia growing a little again. &nbsp;Not that I do anything on line to be ashamed of. Should I feel better under the Obama administration? &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;Obama did sign the Patriot Act extension in February, 2010. http://www.washingtontimes.com/... I&#8217;m pretty sure every word I type is being read by someone in a super, secret room, somewhere. &nbsp;After all, we have spent tons of money since 911 on ever expanding security.  &#8220;Since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, top-secret intelligence gathering by the government has grown so unwieldy and expensive that no one really knows what it cost and how many people are involved, The Washington Post reported. In its first installment of a series of reports, the Post said there are now more than 1,200 government organizations and more than 1,900 private companies working on counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in some 10,000 locations across the U.S. Some 854,000 people &#8212; or nearly 1 1/2 times the number of people who live in Washington &#8212; have top-secret security clearance, the paper said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Post that he doesn't believe the massive bureaucracy of government and private intelligence has grown too large to manage, but it is sometimes hard to get precise information.&#8221; "Nine years after 9/11, it makes sense to sort of take a look at this and say, 'OK, we've built tremendous capability, but do we have more than we need?" he said.   http://www.krqe.com/... Really, Gates? &nbsp;You think it might be a little too much? &nbsp;All those people need to keep busy doing something. &nbsp;Almost a million people monitoring us (that we know of), hmmmmmmmm that works out to about one for every three hundred people in this country, not counting other kinds of police and security everywhere. &nbsp;And they do get lots of help from ATT and Google and other internet providers. &nbsp;OMG...It is Big Brother! &nbsp;What&#8217;s that old saying: &nbsp;It&#8217;s not paranoia if it&#8217;s real? &nbsp;I&#8217;m counting on the fact that they have way too much information to sort through, but I wonder sometimes when I write things like: Right now I&#8217;m plotting my last minute assault.....on the stores for a Christmas present for my dog. or: &nbsp;If anyone wants to buy a dozen AK 47&#8217;s.....then they should be willing to give their name and address. and: &nbsp;I&#8217;m waging my own personal jihad against.....materialism by being too poor to buy anything. When I write these things, I find myself waiting for a knock on my door (or someone kicking it in), and after a couple of days, the paranoia lessons. &nbsp;I hate censorship and even more, self censorship. &nbsp;I really don&#8217;t like having to think about my word choices, but these guys don&#8217;t take humor and kidding into account. &nbsp;Sometimes paranoia can be based in reality. &nbsp; We live in a new age where every word you write can be taken literally. There are people who got arrested because of their tweets and Facebook posts:  We've taken a look at 8 cases where Twitter overshares, "jokes," and opinionated tweets have gotten people arrested. 19 Facebook posts that got people arrested,   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/... Maybe a little paranoia can be a good thing. Then, I have my conspiracy theories like: &nbsp;The MSM is trying to sell us Sarah Palin for our next President or The New Congress and Catfood Commision are trying to get us ready to do without SS, and corporations have infiltrated every part of our government, even the SC. &nbsp;Naaahhhhh...those things are just in my mind. &nbsp;There&#8217;s even an online magazine for people like me:  Who is reabducting UFO abductees? What role do magick and ritual play in The Invisible Government? Have we received any messages from space? Plus, everything you always wanted to know about UFO think tanks and the mother of all think tanks: Tavistock. This exclusive collection also features the final solution to the economic downturn: Entomophagy (eating insects)!   http://www.paranoiamagazine.com/ There are thoughts I won&#8217;t even write here or speak out loud; because I know they will bring the heat on me, and I will be renditioned and waterboarded and never heard from again. &nbsp;Thank goodness they haven&#8217;t figured out how to read my mind and get me for thought crime yet. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure they are working on it though. They are doing a lot of research with MRI&#8217;s and the brain lately. </text>

	<title>conspiracy theories about UFOs</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 11:40:53 AM PST</date>
	<author>House of Gin</author>
	<text>conspiracy theories about UFOs I haven't really seen evidence of UFOs and it seems odd that they only abduct those with low intelligence. A bit easy to discard. Paranoia about the patriot act feels a little more realistic because we have historical examples like the stasi and KGB. Not to mention all of the CIA's documented shenanigans. Not real worried though because I feel pretty free and we're free to discuss this. I do think the threat of terrorism is trumped up and they foresaw the economy declining so wanted powers to go after protesters are revolutionarys. But things aren't bad enough to revolt yet so I'm not revolting, so it's like I have nothing to hide so I'm not worried about invasion of privacy. But the word yet is a keyword here.</text>

	<title>Something to Genuinely Recognize is Private</title>

	<author>Gooserock</author>
	<text>Something to Genuinely Recognize is Private discrimination and consequences 10,20,30 years from now for associations and public statements made in this time. Remember what happened during the 50's Red Scare to people who'd had socialist or communist affiliations decades earlier during the First Great Depression. People who are imprudent today could find themselves with opportunity limitations in the future by private employers, social networks, clubs, churches or whatever.</text>

	<author>rubine</author>
	<text>I've written comments encouraging... demonstrations that would, hopefully, frighten the ruling elite (incl. this one today), based on the presumption that they currently think we're all a bunch of sheep so they can get away with anything. &nbsp;Which is what they are currently getting away with. As a result I received a strange email from "newusername" who purported to be sympathetic and to be someone they weren't, and asked me questions about my beliefs and who shared those beliefs. I ignored it and continue to express the belief that a non-violent, but massive, protest movement is all we have left in terms of bringing down our plutocracy.</text>
