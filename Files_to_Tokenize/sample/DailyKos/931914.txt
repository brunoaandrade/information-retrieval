	<text>   We've heard it too many times:  &#8220;the worst shooting in US history&#8230;&#8221;   With saddened respect to all those who are mourning victims of various public outrages, these may also be teachable moments for the US about her own history. For it is an insult to the native people of this hemisphere to overlook their collective slaughter with mass shootings by the US cavalry ending barely 100 years ago.   How hyped 9/11 was as the worst bloodshed in the US people since the Civil War. Which is an outrageous truncation of history - the total negation of the war against the plains Indian tribes. The US&#8217; common incapacity to understand her own history becomes her collective blindness towards current and future circumstance. As to seldom learned US history, consider the massacre of Wounded Knee.  December 29, 1890 Briefly, depending on who does the counting (and numbers are hotly contested between &#8220;official&#8220; sources and the Lakota people), between around 350 to over 500 people were shot down in a mass slaughter on that date. Most of the people were sick, starved, and exhausted from being pursued by the US cavalry. They were attacked at dawn. A great number of those slain that day were elderly, very sick, or infants. Nursing mothers were shot in the back, babies were tossed into the air as targets. Corpses lay frozen in the snow for days afterwards. A mass slaughter by gunfire.  Maybe it wasn&#8217;t the worst of the Indian shootings, although some say it was. For there were many such instances. Again, by the late 1880&#8217;s the US Cavalry was employing genocidal tactics (supplying trading posts with smallpox-infected blankets, etc.) to slaughter the remaining Indians who did not want to live in those prison camps we now call reservations. Ironically, the massacre at Wounded Knee occurred in response to a native American interpretation of the Christian gospel:  By the late 1880s, many Indian tribes, desperate and facing a dire existence of poverty, hunger and disease, sought a means of salvation to revitalize their traditional culture. The evolution of a new religion, the Ghost Dance, was a reaction to the Indians being forced to submit to government authority and reservation life. In early 1889, a Paiute shaman, Wovoka, (son of the mystic, Tavibo, whose teachings influenced the new religion) had a vision during an eclipse of the sun in which he saw the second coming of Christ and received a warning about the evils of the white man&#8230; Knowledge of the vision spread quickly through the Indian camps across the country. Word began to circulate among the people on the reservations that a great new Indian Messiah had come to liberate them, and investigative parties were sent out to discover the nature of these claims. On one of the excursions, it is said that the messiah appeared to an Arapaho hunting party, crowned with thorns. They believed him to be the incarnation of Jesus, returned to save the Indian nations from the scourge of white people. Delegations were sent to visit Wovoka in western Nevada and returned to their camps disciples, preaching a new religion that promised renewal and revitalization of the Indian nations. Among those who met with Wovoka, Good Thunder, Short Bull, and Kicking Bear became prominent leaders of the new religion which was called the Ghost Dance by white people because of its precepts of resurrection and reunion with the dead. [source].   Their belief:  Kicking Bear (quoting Wovoka): "The earth is getting old, and I will make it new for my chosen people, the Indians, who are to inhabit it, and among them will be all those of their ancestors who have died... I will cover the earth with new soil to a depth of five times the height of a man, and under this new soil will be buried the whites...The new lands will be covered with sweet-grass and running water and trees, and herds of buffalo and ponies will stray over it, that my red children may eat and drink, hunt and rejoice." [source]   This is US Christian history - or will some deny that the illiterate can experience legitimate faith?  By August of 1890, the U.S. government was fearful that the Ghost Dance was actually a war dance and, in time, the dancers would turn to rioting. By November, the War Department sent troops to occupy the Lakota camps at Pine Ridge and Rosebud, convinced that the dancers were preparing to do battle against the government. In reality, the Indians were bracing themselves to defend their rights to continue performing the sacred ceremonies. In reaction to the military encampment, the Lakotas planned various strategies to avoid confrontation with the soldiers, but the military was under orders to isolate Ghost Dance leaders from their devotees[source].    The US Cavalry saw women doing the Ghost Dance, and failed to realize that women never participate in war dances. The misunderstandings multiplied. Here is one account of all that happened (you will notice wildly differing numbers of those assassinated going from one website to another).  Wovoka's gospel of salvation was filled with Christian as well as Indian elements. Men and women were first to purify themselves and forswear alcohol and violence. Then they were to dance in a large circle, chanting and appealing to the spirits of their ancestors. When they did, Wovoka promised, the whites would vanish, the buffalo would cover the earth again.   "The Ghost Dance, I think, was a desperate prayer. They thought that, well, it may be possible that all of this has been a bad dream, or all of this is passing and there will be the restoration of the world we knew and loved." - N. Scott Momaday  The people, wearing the sacred shirts and feathers, now formed a ring. We boys were in it. All joined hands. Everyone was respectful and quiet, expecting something wonderful to happen... The leaders beat time and sang as the people danced, going round to the left in a sidewise step. Occasionally, someone... fell unconscious into the center... As each one came to, she, or he slowly sat up and looked about, bewildered, and then began wailing inconsolably.   Pine Ridge Agency November 12th, 1890 We need protection and we need it now. Indians are dancing in the snow and are wild and crazy... The leaders should be arrested and confined at some military post until the matter is quieted, and this should be done at once. Daniel F. Royer  Responding to the pleas of a frightened Indian agent, Washington dispatched General Nelson A. Miles with 5,000 troops, including the Seventh Cavalry, Custer's old command. At Pine Ridge and Rosebud in South Dakota, the ghost dancers feared that the soldiers had come to attack them, and fled to a remote plateau surrounded by cliffs which nervous whites soon began calling "the Stronghold." &nbsp;   The presence of the great warrior Sitting Bull alarmed the Calvary, who expressed concern that the Ghost Dance would turn to violence. Therefore the military was ordered to arrest those imagined to be the agitators including the Sioux Chiefs Sitting Bull and Big Foot. On December 15, 1890, Sitting Bull and eight of his warriors were slain at the Standing Rock reservation by agency police sent to arrest him, who claimed Sitting Bull had resisted arrest. Some of Sitting Bull's followers escaped to Big Foot&#8217;s camp of Miniconjou Sioux, many of whom were Ghost Dancers. Big Foot did not want to further aggravate the situation. But due to the murder of Sitting Bull, Big Foot was counted as one of the "fomenters of disturbances," and his arrest had been ordered, resulting in his group being transferred to Fort Bennett. On the night on December 23, a band of 350 people left the Miniconjou village concealed by darkness beginning their150 mile week-long trek through the frozen Badlands to hopefully find shelter at Pine Ridge Agency. They carried the elderly Chief Big Foot (who had pneumonia) in hopes of discovering Chief Red Cloud's promise to them of food, shelter, and horses. The Indians say that Big Foot and Red Cloud wanted peaceful terms with the US Calvary. They were encompassed by the troops of Major Samuel M. Whitside and the Seventh Calvary (General George Custer's erstwhile regiment) on December 28. Big Foots' people hoisted a white flag, but the army drove the band to the bank of Wounded Knee Creek where they looked up along the ridge to see four Hotchkiss cannons aimed at them. The Calvary's supposed intention was to remove them to a different local camp, but a rumor was panicking the Indians, that they were to be deported to Indian Territory (Oklahoma), reputed for worse living conditions than any prison. Colonel James Forsyth arrived with reinforcements that evening to take command of the situation. The Indians were interrogated throughout the night, leaving them sleepless as well as panicked. Eyewitnesses reported soldiers drinking and reveling all night in celebration of capturing Big Foot. Soldiers stripped the Indians of their weapons, which further agitated tensions. While the soldiers searched for weapons, some of the Indians began singing Ghost Dance songs, and one of them (possibly the medicine man Yellow Bird) threw dirt in a ceremonial gesture. This action was misinterpreted by the soldiers as a sign of imminent hostile aggression. &nbsp;Moments later a gun discharged. It was said that a deaf man - Black Coyote - accidentally fired as soldiers tried to wrest his gun from him. Although no one was injured, the soldiers immediately sprayed the unarmed Indians with shots from small arms together with rounds from Hotchkiss canons staged on the ridge above (Hotchkiss canons fire two pound explosive shells at a rate of fifty per minute).   With only their bare hands to fight back, the Indians tried to defend themselves, but the incident deteriorated further into bloody chaos, and the [350 - ?] unarmed Indians were outmatched and outnumbered by the nearly 500 U.S. soldiers. Most of the Indian fatalities occurred during the initial ten to twenty minutes, but sporadic firing lasted for several hours as cavalrymen pursued Indians who fled to a nearby ravine. Indian survivors remarked that the soldiers cried out "Remember the Little Bighorn" as they their human prey shrank back in a lethal game of hide and seek -- for which reason they believed the massacre to be revenge for Custer&#8217;s annihilation at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876 (Recorded by Santee Sioux, Sid Byrd, from oral histories of several survivors.) Exposure to freezing weather killed off many survivors, and corpses were scattered some two to five miles from the point where the slaughter initiated. &nbsp;It is said that by mid-afternoon of that day, December 29, 1890 - the sport-like firing ceased. &nbsp;Numbers fluctuate according to which side tells them - between 300-500 men (Big Foot included), women and children - old and young, and a great many already quite sick - laid dead on the icy banks of Wounded Knee Creek. &nbsp;Twenty-nine soldiers on the US side perished from what most believed was "friendly fire" among troops who were said to be drinking. &nbsp;Nevertheless, twenty-three soldiers from the Seventh Calvary received the Congressional Medal of Honor for their efforts in slaying defenseless Indians that day.   The writing of any history - and particularly the history of the American Indian - in such a way that its true realities are transmitted without distortion is an almost impossible challenge. Words on a page can hold the elements of history, but not how it felt to be there. The colors, the sounds, the smells - they are all gone. It was not common for American Indian statements to be recorded except by the white world. Additionally, the military perspective is shrouded in accusations and blame between officers. Many denounced the events of Wounded Knee as a criminal act while others supported the awards of medals of honor to surviving soldiers.source    &#8220;I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud, and was buried in the blizzard. A people&#8217;s dream died there. It was a beautiful dream.&#8221; - Black Elk  Soldier&#8217;s Perspective: Prior to the events, Colonel Forsyth instructed, &#8220;Disarm the Indians. Take every precaution to prevent their escape. If they choose to fight, destroy them.&#8221; As the bullets flew, Forsyth shouted, &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, stop shooting them.&#8221; On April 12, 1920, Lt. General Nelson A. Miles (retired) said in his testimony before the Commission on Indian Affairs: &#8220;The action of the officer was more reprehensible . . . and I have regarded the whole affair as most unjustifiable and worthy of the severest condemnation.&#8221;source     However, the most damning words came from the media. If there is a true villain of Wounded Knee, it is the media who sensationalized the story. Many historians theorize that without the general call for &#8220;more Indian blood&#8221; in many print forms that there might not have been a massacre at Wounded Knee. Once this blood that had been &#8220;hollered for&#8221; was shed, the American Indians formerly called &#8220;treacherous&#8221; and &#8220;murderous&#8221; were now &#8220;innocent victims.&#8221; The soldiers formerly depicted as heroic defenders of the frontier were now guilty of &#8220;slaughter without provocation.&#8221; Politics also came into play: Both Republican and Democratic papers resurrected the ghost of George Armstrong Custer and joined in promoting the false notion that the Seventh Cavalry had somehow participated to avenge Custer&#8217;s fall. source    Citizens of the contemporary US, with the exception of veterans of foreign wars, have seen nothing of war compared with the native peoples who lived here, once Europeans brought mass slaughter and cultural eradication. &nbsp;While there are quarrels about the numbers, no one doubts they went into the millions. &nbsp;Even the Civil War was a scant taste of death compared to previous centuries and the arrival of the Spanish. A better understanding of history is the sole hope of healing the fledgling democracy recently called the US. Epilogue  The passengers in the gondola are the native chiefs who were taken captive following the battle of Wounded Knee. In order to destroy leadership and the will of the plains people, these men were paroled into a bizarre forced exile as actors in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show on its tour through Europe (the photo was taken in Venice, Italy). </text>

	<text>We must never let man's worst spirit loose Whether it is Germans using Jewish babies for target practice or Americans using Indian infants the same way, the horror is the same. &nbsp;The horror isn't simply the needless deaths of innocents but the fact that humans who aren't society's outcasts and criminals can act this way.

Not outcasts at all, those murderers. &nbsp;They received the highest commendation our Congress could award for their heartless slaughter. We'll always have criminals who murder but we must never allow governments to take on such murder as their official function. &nbsp;Such behavior shames us as a human race. I was forced to watch helplessly when we invaded Iraq and killed innocents once more. &nbsp;I don't know what I can do to prevent such slaughter again, other than work to elect politicians who are against such things. &nbsp;Any better ideas gratefully accepted.</text>

	<text>cadenza I was born in Montana in 1956, 65 years after the massacre at Wounded Knee. My mind was saturated with a cognitive dissonance: &nbsp;on the one hand, we were taught to celebrate our pioneering past ("there's so much history in the west" - as though no one else had any), with songs like Montana, Montana Glory of the west of all the states from coast to coast you're easily the best We dressed as pioneers in the fourth of July parades... you get the picture. On the other hand, our family had native American friends, and at one point I had two native foster brothers who had been removed from mothers who were prostituting their daughters in the toxic ruin of their ancient ways, there in those prison camps which were transformed into "reservations" (eventually viewed as sovereign nations, to more or less effective degrees). &nbsp;I loved those brothers, and it is another story but their presence in our home certainly saved my life. We would prowl the hills with archeology buffs, seeing tipi rings, buffalo jumps, arrowheads scattered on the ground as a token of previous civilization abruptly dispersed and shackled away, now forbidden even to speak their native tongue, made into "farmers" quite against their nomadic will. Jump cut to now: &nbsp;we've lived more than four years in Mexico, a country littered with pyramids. &nbsp;We share village life with the scions of those who built them - even the CIA factbook explains that only some 10% of Mexicans are fully European (Spanish). &nbsp;Yet people stream down from the states, demanding that the young of this village learn to speak English. I have a dear friend who graduated as a civil engineer with honors who had no idea there were pyramids on her continent. One friend says I ruined her for blogging life, once she began to see the "illegal immigrants" as mostly native Americans. You get my drift. &nbsp;A vast act of psycho-social dwarfism has occurred in the name of education. Let's start spreading the word.</text>

	<text>Thanks for bringing this together. A couple of years ago I read "Flyboys" by James Bradley. If I remember correctly, that book covered our treatment of Indians (and of Filipinos at a slightly later date) in explaining the barbarity of the Japanese treatment of U. S. prisoners in the Pacific in WW II. His thesis was that as the Japanese tried to learn how a modern military worked around the turn of the 20th century, they picked up some of their attitudes towards enemies from our behaviors towards those groups along with the rest of the military knowledge they were seeking. It was a real eye-opener to me.</text>

	<author>stonemason</author>
	<text>Interesting your mention of the Japanese internment camps... there is one of what I believe are only two remaining examples at Heart Mountain between Cody and Powell, Wyoming. I used to hike those hills, examine the remains of their terraced gardens, and Powell has made an exemplary effort to preserve it and keep the memory alive of what can happen in fits of nationalism. Somewhere I encountered a page on the internet explaining that there was absolutely no public discussion before yanking the Japanese Americans - born US citizens - from their homes. &nbsp;Neither was there any Congressional discussion of the issue. &nbsp;It was totally by surprise, done and over before anyone knew to ask questions. &nbsp; This is because executive decree trumps the normal Constitution during a declaration of national emergency - something very few US people realize is the situation today. &nbsp;By executive decree alone, all those US citizens lost everything they had.</text>

I was acquainted with an artist from Idaho Falls who was said to have been in one of those camps, although from his obituary it is unclear if he was actually evacuated to a camp or just to southern Idaho in some other way.

	<text>My mom is part indian I do not trust what she says is the tribe though. Her family is from west Virginia in the south. She says we are part Cherokee but I always have played that off as just "everyone is Cherokee: kind of stuff.. So I am not even sure it was true as I am unsure if the Cherokee lived in that area? I am only asking this cause I figured someone would know if this is correct or even feasible.. My mom relates a store where an Indian who traded with my family fell in love with a daughter sometime prior to the civil war.. I am going to be getting a book in the mail that has genealogy in it. I am sorry this is slightly of topic but thought somoene with more knowledge about the Indian nations would be able to help even tell me if me being part Cherokee is even plausible. &nbsp;</text>

	<author>ctami</author>
	<text>Cherokee were Iroquois? I only recall five tribes of the Iroquois League from my New York State history, joined by a sixth in the early 1700s. The Cherokee were not among them, to my knowledge. Also did not know there were Iroquois nations in the Southeast, unless you count the Tuscarora, who emigrated from the Carolinas north to join the Iroquois League as the Sixth Nation. The Iroquois were located (and still are) by and large, in the northeast and specifically central and Western New York.</text>

	<text>The poster is probably mistaken as you said. The five nations ruled around the new york area and into canada though ive read they stretched much farther south. And the Six nations included the Tuscarora of course which would explain the idea that they controlled territory in perhaps virginia, wv, nc etc. The poster is mistaken about the placement of the cherokee as well. There is a Cherokee reservation in NC and when southeasterners claim native blood theyre speaking of cherokee blood.</text>

	<text>This might help. http://www.legendsofamerica.com/...  Evidence indicates that the Cherokee migrated in prehistoric times from present-day Texas or northern Mexico to the Great Lakes area. However, wars with the Iroquois and Delaware tribes, who controlled those lands, pushed the Cherokee southeast to the mountains and valleys of the southern part of the Appalachian chain. They eventually settled in modern Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama.  </text>

	<title>Around the time of the Trail of Tears there</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 06:40:51 AM PST</date>
	<author>OHdog</author>
	<text>Around the time of the Trail of Tears there was a Cherokee diaspora in the South Eastern US. Many families moved northward and into the mountainous areas so it is possible. Native American ancestry can often be confirmed by dental characteristics. If you or close relatives have shovel-shaped incisors, that's a clue. Also if you or relatives have had to pay extra for a root canal on first molars because of three roots instead of the usual Caucasian two roots, that's another clue. Both occurring in the same jaw ups the probability to near 100%. I do not know if the inheritance pattern of each is "dominant" or "recessive".</text>

	<title>The Cherokee</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 02:36:39 PM PST</date>
	<author>cdreid</author>
	<text>The Cherokee along with the Iroquois and others were Great Nations hundreds of years ago. We've been taught to see 'indians' as roving bands of violent hippy nomads. They were anything but. Both controlled nations larger than most european states. Both had formidable military and econommic power. Both had very sophisticated governmental systems which could best be described as federal republics. Both had astonishing art and culture, most of which we destroyed just as the central and south american settlers eventually took over and destroyed native populations artifacts and cultures. They didnt control small hunting areas or &nbsp;local villages, they controlled entire regions of what we now call the US. In fact one of the upper class's biggest objections to Chavez in Venezuela is his standing up for the native people whom Venezuela has been working hard to annihilate. If you want a better picture of native americans before we near succeeded in genocide read about the Cherokee in the Revolutionary war. Read about the French and Indian war - perhaps the single most important war in american history. The "ancient" native american nations were powers to be contended with even by the most powerful militaries on the planet.</text>

	<text>I think we lost a LOT when we lost native civilisation. Im not talking about the pueblo who everyone adore as desert-hippies. Im talking whole civilisations. With ancient legal systems and cultures. With technologies that are lost forever too us. Particularly farming technologies. With ways of surviving Better and more comfortably in the same time and place as europeans who had to rape the land and turn it into an eyesore for even a sole family to survive. An american up to 100 years ago had to rape a large area of the land around him just to barely survive. The native americans as far as i know never chopped down a forest (excluding the mayans/incans whos culture was easily as horrific as european culturre), never slaughtered entire species, never girdled hundreds of acres of trees just for firewood and farmland to support one family etc. Yet they farmed. They had everything the europeans did except steel,iron and gunpowder. Maybe because their very way of living made the thought of raping huge areas of land and enslaving hundreds to do so was antithetical to their entire way of life.</text>

	<author>stonemason</author>
	<text>I'm on the run at the moment but you might find it interesting to look into how native tribes carefully maintained forests. &nbsp;If you don't find something quickly on a google, let me know and I'll dig through my notes. The entire failure of the US Forest Service - which has ruined most of the Rocky Mountain forests in under 100 years - has been predicated on the assumption that native Americans did nothing to safeguard forest health, and thereby they too could get away with doing absolutely nothing. As you observe, indeed they did not ruin forests or carry on with wholesale destruction. &nbsp;But they did limb out trees, thin forests (in contrast to Yellowstone when it burned, with all spindly growth bunched up like hair on a boar's back, leaving it almost impassible and highly prone to fire in drought years) and would eliminate deadfall - something the Forest Service insists on micromanaging to death and impeding voluntary public participation in this necessary task. &nbsp; In a word, the USFS's assumption that native peoples were too dumb to care for forests - and that they ought to do the same - has cost the western US entire forests now that budworms are destroying them wholesale.</text>

	<text>The more we understand human genetics the less the old system of Blood Quanta of 1/2, 1/4, etc. inheritance means anything other than a social history of one's ancestry. Important to a family's history and culture but not a direct correlation to which genes came from where (except for the matrilineal descent traced through mitochondria or partrilineal y-chromosome inheritance). A striking misuse was the recent denial of recognized Cherokee heritage to the many so-called Black Cherokees by the current leaders of those tribal governments. The Dawes Rolls census of Native Americans from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were based on racist determinations but are still used as the best extant "proof" of ancestry.</text>

	<title>The Statue of Liberty is by a little known</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 08:24:30 AM PST</date>
	<author>sclminc</author>
	<text>The Statue of Liberty is by a little known massacre site. On Feb. 25, 1643, Dutch soldiers massacred 120 Native Americans who thought the Dutch were their allies and fled to right by what's now the Statue of Liberty park to get away from another tribe. To their credit, some Europeans tried to save the Native Americans, and many Europeans understood very clearly that what had happened was a terrible thing. But it's important when we read about the Rape of Nanking, or the problems between England and Ireland and the Israel and Palestine, and think, "How could THEY do such horrible things?" to remember that "WE did such horrible things." It's fair to point out that Native Americans were capable of doing terrible things, too, and the fact that we all do it excuses none of it, but we need to have some humility when we're figuring out how to help other people's overcome bouts of this terrible madness, and when we're considering policies of our own that could lead to a slippery slope back down into the muck.</text>

	<text>"We need to have some humility." Very true. Also, we need to recognize that the destructive potential, and the ability to categorize other people as "not really human," will always be part of our human nature -- as potentials. We need to be developing the kinds of education and culture that will allow us to recognize and step away from those destructive potentials, while developing the positive and creative potentials of the human nature that we share with all peoples.</text>

	<author>cdreid</author>
	<text>We didnt do anything anymore than living black people were slaves or living italians ruled the world or living spanish people ruled large parts of america. People we share a genetic link to did horrific things.. some of them at least. And largely only because of ignorance and disinformation fed to them. Theres little difference between ancient pulps and papers screaming hysterically about homicidal evil indians and the modern american demonisation of arabs or Iraqis or Soviets. But.. we had at least some say in these and better information. And we didnt nuke the soviets or allow the government to commit genocide in Iraq. In fact if you look at Bosnia/Serbia and Clintons one shining moment attempting to intervene in Somalia we also have some very bright moments of moral clarity.</text>

	<text>There is a lot of info about Indian history here on DKOs, written by Native Americans who are part of this community. You might want to check out the "Indians 101" series, by Ojibwa. His knowledgeable diaries cover a wide range of topics, such as "Indians of the Southern Plains," "The Winnebago Uprising," "The Iroquois False Face Society," "Jesuit Missionaries in Arizona," etc -- as well as brief biographies of various Indian historical figures. Ojibwa has also done some fascinating pieces on cultures in ancient Africa. &nbsp;His diaries are a great addition to what most of us learned (or didn't learn) about history.</text>

	<text>thank you stonemason our history is replete with tales of wholesale slaughter that are spun as victories for democracy and freedom. Revisionist history, replete with villains and heroes to sell our dark dreams as liberty and freedom, have brought us to this point, where the MIC is allowed to wage endless preemptive &nbsp;war on other humans we deem as barbarians and not worthy of even counting the dead we pile up. Too bad the Texas school board and those that would turn the daytime night write the stories that we teach our children in order to keep the killing profitable accepted as the price of freedom. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</text>

	<title>I led the fight at Wounded Knee 1973</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 11:29:35 AM PST</date>
	<author>cacamp</author>
	<text>I led the fight at Wounded Knee 1973 There are still a lot of misunderstanding about Wounded Knee and the Ghost Dance. But what's little known is that there is a close parallel to todays politics. The GOP was trying to thwart the Democrats in the western states on behalf of mining and other corporate interests. They encouraged radical and racist anti-Indian local politicians in seeking to bring i federal troops to put down a false "uprising" to acquire Indian lands for exploitation. Anew book about the domestic politics has just been released and was reviewed by Navajo and some other kossacks. I'll get the name and add it to this asap. In 1973 I was the Chairman of the American Indian Movement(AIM) and led the warrior society in a 73 day liberation of Wounded Knee. It too was the culmination of many years of trying to get the USA to live up to their side of our treaties. Wounded Knee remains a very sacred place to my people so we felt it fitting to make our stand for our rights there. It was 73 days of the freest time of my life even though I did go to prison for a couple of years afterwards. Here's a quote from todays FP....   Jon Wiener picks the top 10 Nixon quotes from tapes released this year from the National Archives put the former President on the front page briefly: On the standoff at Wounded Knee with Native American militants: "I think we ought to move tanks, the whole goddamned thing. Put a division in there, if necessary, It's time for action on it. If some Indians get shot, that's too goddamned bad. If some Americans get shot, that's too bad, too."  </text>

	<title>Wounded Knee, Party Politics and the</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 11:42:10 AM PST</date>
	<author>cacamp</author>
	<text>Wounded Knee, Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre by Heather Cox Richardson. To get a real understanding of the USA politics which drove the 1890 massacre I recommend this book. I think you'll find that the Ghost Dance was merely an excuse to kill some Indians in service of national politics. Just as Nixons desire to kill us during WK 1973 was politic in nature. I also think you'll be surprised at how much todays rise of the tea party radicals parallels the politics of 1890. A Main Selection of the History Book Club &nbsp;  On December 29, 1890, American troops opened fire with howitzers on hundreds of unarmed Lakota Sioux men, women, and children near Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota, killing nearly 300 Sioux. In Wounded Knee, acclaimed historian Heather Cox Richardson illustrates how the massacre grew out of a set of political forces all too familiar to us today: fierce partisanship, heated political rhetoric, and an irresponsible, profit-driven media. Richardson tells a dramatically new story about the Wounded Knee massacre, revealing that its origins lay not in the West but in the corridors of political power back East. Politicians in Washington, Democrat and Republican alike, sought to set the stage for mass murder by exploiting an age-old political tool &#8212; fear. Assiduously researched and beautifully written, Wounded Knee will be the definitive account of an epochal American tragedy.  </text>

	<title>Hi,</title>
	<date>Tue Dec 28, 2010 at 11:49:36 AM PST</date>
	<author>stonemason</author>
	<text>Hi, It's great to hear from you. Yes I've read there were horrible things going on, and one that stands out concerned some vans subjecting the locals to microwaves, and such things. It's never about the surface appearance is it? In fact a good friend lost an entire ranch in your area on false pretexts once uranium and other minerals were discovered beneath their land. &nbsp;They raided them on a bogus charge of dealing drugs, which was later proven untrue because nothing of the kind was going on. &nbsp;But they seized their bank accounts which naturally caused checks to bounce, then pressured the family to plead guilty to banking fraud charges by threatening to take their children away. &nbsp;Pure evil menace. &nbsp;Greed gone off the charts at work. &nbsp;Their father just got out of prison last month. So sad to remember this date. &nbsp;It was the least I could do to remember your people on this sorrowful anniversary. &nbsp;I was hoping it would stay up longer - guess I jumped the gun because when I posted it was already December 29 on the other side of the planet. Blessings, peace to you.</text>
