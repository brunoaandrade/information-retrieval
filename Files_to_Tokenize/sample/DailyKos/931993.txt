	<text>  My last diary An Idiot's Guide to Product Photographywas very technical and to put it bluntly, not very pretty but it did cover a lot of ground and hopefully provided a better understanding of some of the technical aspects of photography. It also showed a neat way of building a very cheap tabletop 'studio'. This diary is the complete antithesis to that one. It is very light on the technical and heavy on the eye candy and seemed appropriate as the year closes out. Anyway, back to the point; These are some of my personal favorites that I have shot with a sentence or two about why I like them - I would really like to see what appeals to others - which of their &nbsp;own photographs they like best with a line or two about why. A version of this crossposted on my blog; Favorite Photographs 2010 | Minimalist Photography   My favorite subject matter is people, not posed but going about normal activities, in conversation, walking, working etc. I haven't included any of those shots because I am not comfortable, at present, with posting likenesses on the web, even with permission. I am going to review this but I really want to think it through - I suspect that my compromise will be if they have a recognizable likeness on say, Facebook or Twitter I'll ask their permission to use one in these diaries. There are other photographs that I am not allowed to post for contractual reasons. These two catagories, people and commissions, represent a lot of the best work I've done this year - the images below are a sort of best of the rest and personal favorites even if not technically perfect.  I like looking through the viewfinder and being surprised and this one did it. It was the first time that I'd ever looked through a very wide angle lens (efl 14mm) and everything seemed perfect, the stopped car and the clouds and clear sky behind the stop lights made this. I converted to black and white by editing the color channels hence the very dark 'blue' areas and straightened out some of the distortion.  It is easy to make certain things look good in black and white, newborn babies and old people being two such examples. Making nature look good in black and white without relying on repeating patterns is a killer though and this is probably the shot where I think that I came the closest to pulling it off.  This one was part of a project that I thoroughly enjoyed and got a lot of satisfaction from. I like this particular shot it because of the symbolism or rather metaphor implied. Macbeth was always my favorite Shakespeare play and this image reverses the main roles.  This one allows my inner 18 year old horror show freak full reign. It is a stalk of brussel sprouts but I flipped the image on its side to get the deformed spine aesthetic going. &nbsp;I was raised on the old British ultra low budget Hammer Horror films with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and loads of other Brits who went on to become famous in the mainstream - Oliver Reid being one that springs to mind.  This is a tiny detail of a day lily but that is not why it is is here. It is a very simple image but it keeps a lot hidden, it is impossible to know what it is and it is also very difficult to get a sense of scale. This one definitely works for me on a very abstract level.  I am a sucker for distortion. Many photographers spend a lifetime fighting it while I actively search it out. This was taken at the same time as the image of the high st at the top of this post and the black and white conversion was done the same way but I didn't touch the barrel distortion.  The brief was for a honey crisp apple that the looks as if it can be pulled out of the image and eaten. Not as easy as it sounds. I spent half a day trying every setup that I could from solid tungsten light in the basement to daylight in the studio to every room in my house. The set up that finally worked was the apple on the roof of our car, in the garage with flash bounced off the silver insulation bubble wrap type stuff on the ceiling. I put this one in because it represents a solution to a problem and I enjoy the problem solving side of photography as much as the art side.  This appeals to my love of the abstract in general and minimalism in particular. It is the same car as in the previous photo, a Mercury Sable. The visible parts are the edge of a door and the back of a wing mirror. It captures the dolphin like aesthetic that the car designers obviously liked using a tiny unrecognizable on its own part.  I love old movies and, to be honest, that is where a lot of my photography ideas originate. One thing that has always fascinated me is the differences in the parts of a shot that are out of focus. The technical term for this is bokeh. The quality of this is a direct function of the lense used, some convert highlights to bright well defined circles and others give more of a smeared type effect. This shot is matches my tastes exactly - blurred with a few not really sharply defined circles.  This could have been any one of literally hundreds of photographs that I've taken of food for recipe books over the past year. I actually find this type of photography very relaxing as the end result is very well defined i.e. image that makes one hungry.  This is Meg, my wife and she is great. Here is an example of how great she is; I have stopped telling her when I want/need a new piece of photographic equipment because I know that she will immediately work out what sacrifice she can make so that I can have it. Now I only make announcements when I know there is enough cash in the bank and even then I try to be as parsimonious as possible. She has been the one who has instigated every major equipment purchase as she has a knack of knowing when I have outgrown something about three months before it crosses my mind.  You can fill in your own caption for this one. All I will say is that this is Tabby and she is around 13 years old but decided to stop any further development at around the age of 6 months. She is very grumpy, not independent in the slightest, completely neurotic, not very bright (we have had bright cats) &nbsp;and extremely affectionate. Happy New Year!

	<text>I've noticed a lot more photo diaries lately which I think is great. I really am interested in seeing the images that people like that they have shot. I am very visual so seeing an image that appeals to someone, especially one that they have composed gives me as much insight as reading a word based post. As always tips, recs, criticism all welcome and images especially welcome. Thanks for looking/reading</text>

	<text>Those are great I didn't plan on having so many black and white ones (or so few landscapes for that matter) it was just the way it shook out. Our cat is the Chuck Schumer of the animal world (never walks past a camera) - it only has to hear the slight whirr camera zoom makes and it'll come running and pose, no movement and eyes open until it hears the slight click then it goes about its business.</text>

	<author>greenomanic</author>
	<text>the street shots might benefit from being stripped down to more basic elements [more like your other subjects]. &nbsp;there's so much in there... the clouds, the car, trees and shrubs, curbs, buildings, street lamps. &nbsp;lacks a focal point. there's also a school of thought that would say the buildings ought to stand up straight -- realizing that an extreme wide angle doesn't make that easy. &nbsp;but if the buildings are going to be curling up into the sky from the edges of the frame, maybe there ought to be a compelling reason for it. received a gift of a photo book by william eggleston. &nbsp;pretty good... looks impromptu at first glance but there's a lot of depth and a storyline running through the whole set...</text>

	<text>Thet look much better scaled up for that reason - then there is a real sense of space and stillness in the case of the first one. It really does look like a moment frozen. The whole idea of the exercise though was to work wide rather then get in tight with a zoom. I'm trying to treat the street as a landscape as opposed to picking out a detail. &nbsp; </text>

	<text>The sky thing is a bit of a trick and I always come too close to overdoing it. It is all in the post processing. Basically the color information is retained even though the image is black and white so it is possible to say, make all blues very dark or for that matter very light.</text>

	<text>My new camera has a variety of settings that help to enhance colors for things like sunsets and natural shots and I love the way I can shoot practically forever with my digital memory and not run out of film or worry if I want to take images over and over just hoping for the right one (and when I'm not certain I have a fairly still camera during low light photos). I'm amazed that the world was able to do so much before color was invented. &nbsp;The artists that painted the churches and masterpieces back when they were restricted to B&amp;W were so clever! &nbsp;At least it seems that way for someone who enjoys photos.</text>

	<text>I'd never thought of it that way. I'll check out the diary - it was one of my main complaints with my Canon camera and one thing that spurred me to getting the Fuji. &nbsp;The Fuji has a setting that will take four images and then process it into a single one so that the shakes (already minimized) would be minimized even more, if not eliminated. &nbsp;That works very well, though the other special modes worked well in museums on my recent trip. &nbsp;</text>

	<text>Wow! The second one down, &nbsp;slow shutterspeed water one, is wonderful - do you use a blocking filter or is a very small aperture enough? The D60 is still a great camera - I am not a believer in upgrading every five minutes. I still use a Nikon d40x as my main camera and even though it is getting a bit long in the tooth there is nothing in the newer cameras that excites me enough to pension it off yet. Just read the specs on the d50 and it sounds nice!</text>

	<text>Upgrade! seriously the noise reduction actually works on LR3 - it will give you an extra stop and a third easily. I can now work at ISO 1600 on a 3/4 sensor unless I'm doing stock of course. The import feature is much better and copes with multiple cameras really well. Also its lens distortion handling is much improved and very useable. I am a great believer in open source and free but Lightroom is the one exception.</text>

I think the people who take to Lightroom best are the ones that have struggled to set up a workflow in Photoshop and who don't do much composite work i.e. me!</text>

	<author>stevej</author>
	<text>Thanks Normally I shoot color then convert to black and white on the computer. Saying that their is no better way to quickly gain an understanding of tone than to set the viewscreen of a camera to black and white and compare the 'real' color version to the black and white version on the screen. The instant feedback takes months out of the learning curve! The reason for leaving the conversion until after the fact is that the color information is useful insomuch as it gives a lot of room fro manipulation. The dark blue of the skies, lightening of yellow buildings etc. is achieved this way. Gimp open source is a great open source alternative to Photoshop that allows for this type of manipulation. I use Lightroom After a while the eye gets trained to notice subjects and scenes that may be pretty bleh in color but can be striking in black and white. Hope this makes sense - I've made it sound much more complicated than it actually is. Quick thought - good photography is about removing non essential clutter - b/w can be thought of as taking this a stage further by removing color information.</text>

	<text>Hi Eddie I can sympathize - My initial number was about 120 then I got it down to about 40, I made a set on Flickr out of those and just grabbed a dozen for the diary. In the end I decided not to sweat it to much - I really was tying myself in knots. I did make a rule that I wasn't allowed to go back over the editing though - that probably would have resulted in a divorce and no work getting done this week. I like the pic, really solid composition - did you do a little work on the curves? the blacks look a little more solid in the second one - especially the door.</text>

	<text>I don't know what you mean by "curves" but I'd like to. I don't have any real software and use Microsoft Digital Image Pro but I did a real lot with it on this photo. I get very subtle when I mess with photos and usually don't at all but in this one I isolated the awning and touched up the saturation. I took the interior and adjusted the color balance so it would look more incandescent. Shaded the sidewalk and painted in the shadow of the fire escape above that was lost in the bright sunlight. I worked on making the black spots on the dalmatian, black. And yes, I went to town on that door. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</text>

	<author>stevej</author>
	<text>Curves are sort of like levels but allow for a lot more variation. 5.8.&#160;Curves GIMP is basically meant to be a free alternative to Photoshop and it is a really good tool. &nbsp;A sidebar- it takes plugins which are free and there is a really good one for working with RAW images. GIMP - download windows Download UFRaw from SourceForge.net This will actually start the download of the plugin. I would recommend getting to grips with GIMP. There is a learning curve but it is up there with Photoshop as a professional tool. The real difference between the heavy duty tools is the print quality obtainable. I use Adobe Lightroom highly recommended but costs around $300.</text>

	<text>Thank you for the photos and diary Your calm images were a fine accompaniment to my breakfast. I have dabbled a little with photography over the years. &nbsp;I was once the departmental photographer for a past position, but now I just mostly play with it. I live in a delightful visually stimulating place as our house is in the middle of an Old Order Amish community. I have many Amish friends and there are many times I have longed to use a camera to capture a scene, but I can't because to do so would invade their privacy. So I practice taking pictures with my eyes. Thanks again.</text>

	<title>Sounds Idyllic</title>

	<text>Sounds Idyllic pity that it is not possible to photograph the scene but respect for others wishes should always take precedent - I think that this is really important especially now that just about every device has a built in camera. Up until a few years ago it was obvious when a photograph was being taken - not so much nowadays. Regarding my photos the weird thing is that the calm just happened - I never even put the thought into words that that was what I was after - If anything I was always worried about producing static boring images so I tended to overdo the unusual angles and compositions. I have always been concerned with composition and see things a little more in the abstract than most e.g. the curve of a plate loses its identity a little and becomes purely a compositional device - I think. I have to add that composition, to me is about achieving balance without resorting to mirror symmetry as that makes an image static. Negative space is also a biggie but that is probably subject for a diary on its own.</text>

	<title>The Ice Harvest is next month</title>

	<text>The Ice Harvest is next month I think I will ask my friends if I can photograph the process from a distance. They have a small lake on their property and in the coldest part of January they will harvest blocks of ice from the lake for their ice house. It is quite a sight. The wagons loaded with huge blocks of ice and while the waiting draft horses are breathing steam in leather harnesses covered with ice crystals. If I get pictures of just the horses and wagons then it will be okay.</text>

	<text>Sounds like a great opportunity even from a distance some good shots should be possible. I try not to resort to cropping if at all possible but if it is the only way to get a shot I'll do it. A frozen lake, activity and winter sun - really hope that they will let you get some pics.</text>
