	<title>Developers Setting Expectations Ahead of Mac App Store Launch - Mac Rumors</title>

	<text>With Apple's Mac App Storeset to debutin just two days, developers are beginning to set expectations for their applications, particularly in comparison to their other applications already available through the iOS App Store.  On his blogThe Pocket Cyclone, developer Markus Nigrinshares the resultsof a discussion he recently held with several other prominent iOS App Store developers moving their apps to the Mac App Store in the first wave of releases.For the most part, Nigrin's results show that iOS developers moving their apps to the Mac App Store are looking to maintain their existing price points, which frequently fall in the &#36;1.99-&#36;4.99 price range.Why does a 1:1 adoption of the price on the Mac seem so natural for iOS devs?For once, Apple made the code re-use for a native Mac app very straightforward. Every dev I talked to mentioned porting times of less than four weeks. Which were mostly spent on all types of adjustments, like keyboard and HD support. Also, graphical assets for mobile games are typically originated at a much higher resolution anyway, as everybody in the iOS world needs to prepare for a foreseeable future of HD displays. The point is, if you already have the assets and re-creating a native Mac app is relatively low-cost, there is no immediate pressure to go with another pricing model on this platform, if the reward could be an early (chart) success.As far as expectations for sales units go, developers seem to be split, with several of the surveyed developers offering conservative estimates of only 10% of that seen for the corresponding iOS titles, while others have pushed their expectations to as high as double that seen on the iOS platform.  Sales splits between iOS and Mac versions will obviously vary based on a wide range of criteria, including the usefulness of certain types of apps on the two platforms and the overall user experience, where some apps may see more benefit than others in either the portable multi-touch environment of iOS or the larger-screen, pointer-driven Mac environment.</text>

	<text>I'd be interested in seeing what the app store is like &amp; how well it does.  I can see it doing very well.  But hopefully, imo, not so well that Apple decides to make it the only place to get Mac apps as it stands now.  The Mac App Store will be a good, central place to get the basic consumer-level apps, but I doubt we'll see truly professional-grade apps like Adobe Photoshop or something.  But I'm not going to concern myself with that right now.  I'm just going to wait and see how it goes and see what Apple does with it.Why do I get the feeling that Apple's servers will crash or be very slow on the first day or 2 of the app store opening?</text>

	<text>Apple's plan is becoming clearer.Everyone thought the Mac app store was just a way to better sell Mac apps. But it's really not. (Acorn or iLife will be fine with or without this store.)No, this is an attempt to bring some of the iOS developers over to the Mac...someplace they would not have thought to tread before this.Looks like it's gonna work.</text>

	<text>I received a very interesting publicity blurb from one developer whose stuff is going to be sold through the store. Let me quote a few parts of it:a) Our apps will still be available for purchase on our online store. And also, on the Mac App Store.b)  There is no way to &quot;import&quot; a license into the App Store. If you purchased a license on our online store, you will have to keep on using the app that is distributed outside Apple's App Store.c) There are two actual versions of each application, one will be available on the App Store, and the other one will be available outside the App Store. Both versions will be getting updates regularly, at the same time...All the applications available on the App Store have to be tested, and approved by Apple. We developers get a set of guidelines that we have to stick to. That means that a feature that might be available in the out-of-the-store version might not be available in the App Store version, for a given application. Usually, the most feature-rich version will be the one available outside the App Store.</text>

	<text>Like seeing that prices will be pretty close to the same.What I am hoping for is that iwork 11 will be there.  I skipped the last version, but now my ipad created docs are no longer compatible unless I export them as word docs.Also, I hope they allow you to buy ilife apps separately.  All I need is the new imovie.Looking forward to the day when our ipad/iphone apps run natively and data stays in sync on the mac.</text>

	<text>The iOS apps appear to be similar to dashboard widgets.  Look at the stock app for an example.  The biggest difference in the environments is that multiple widgets can run side by side in Dashboard.So will these apps purchased through the Mac App Store run in Dashboard?  Or will Lion do away with Dashboard and move the widget/apps into normal windows within the OS?  Maybe the user will have the option of running it in either location?</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byNuviiOS games converted to OS X? No thanks! Original OS X apps with competitive pricing? Yes, please!Competitive pricing is key. I'm sure the Mac App Store will be a success, but apps can't be priced ridiculously. I hope developers don't plan on charging even more than they do for iPad versions.If porting over iOS apps to the Mac isn'tthatmuch work, hopefully the price will remain low, and the sheer volume of sales will let these developers thrive.</text>

	<text>It seems like the update feature is simply Apple's Software Update feature with third party software allowed access.it would be nice if third party software not offered in the app store could use this.  Some larger software packages might not be practical to offer through the app store but if the developer could get approval to use the update system to check that would be great.  All software updates checked in one place!</text>

	<text>This talk of developers adding HD support to the iOS apps before bringing them over to the Mac. I hope developers aren't going to actually advertise that as a selling point in their Mac App Store descriptions, &quot;Now with HD support&quot;. 1080p may be a new feature for mobile devices when it arrives, but it's a standard resolution for computers with even higher resolutions available.</text>

	<text>I wonder if there will ever be enhanced connectivity between iOS devices and their respective Mac App Store apps? For games, for example, I would love to be able to use my iPhone as either a secondary screen (to equip items, perhaps), a private screen for multiplayer games (that would hide some crucial information from your friends), or as a controller. That alone would entice me to buy a ton of apps!</text>

I see that we are currently in the Vaudeville era of on-line app purchases.  That is anyone without much qualification can get on stage, perform and see if they get flowers or rotten tomatoes.   Some will hit the big time, a professional / delux version will sell via other channels with some developers getting exposure they otherwise could not afford.I don't see this as doom and gloom for anyone except the damn warehouse middle man.  Those guys just clog up channels, under promoted to claim they need more margin and can just die a long and slow death as far as I'm concerned.</text>

That alone would entice me to buy a ton of apps!That's already possible today.Adobe actually demoed some cool stuff last year.And there is an App which allows an iPad to be used as secondary monitor for a Mac.And of course the first and best example of this is Apple's own Remote Control App.</text>

Unfortunately, I think we'll see more &quot;junk&quot; applications too.I think this is a brilliant move by Apple. It's going to attract developers like crazy. I hope it does not attract hackers and viruses too. But again... one of the nice things about Apple's gated walls. Harder for that to happen.</text>

Wonder if he'll throw some attention toward the Mac division again?While unit sales have increased drammatically since the iPhone introduction, you can't deny that innovation in the Mac division has slowed (a major OS X delay, slowdown of Mac hardware revisions, lack of radical design changes, lack of new product lines, slowdown of Mac software revisions, etc).2011 should be interesting for both the Mac and iOS.</text>

If sales are good, then developers will continue to bring outstanding products to the Mac App Store.

	<text>The brilliance of this app store, is it makes it even less intimidating for novices to buy a computer. By dumbing down the Mac, they'll sell even more. There's nothing of significance to learn, and less decisions to make. No thinking required. Apple will increase their revenue by leaps &amp; bounds.</text>

	<text>Like I've stated before, a lot of people are HIGHLY underestimating the Mac App Store. It is going to be huge, and a big part of it is going to be the iOS developers porting and creating apps for the Mac now that there is a central hub (Mac App Store) to release their products to.I can't wait to see what awesome Apps will be released and the ones that will eventually make it to the App Store. It's going to be huge people......it's going to change the way people buy software from now on. (and just wait, Microsoft, and the other companies are going to see if it does become a success, and if so, they'll release their own, you just see)</text>

If the Mac App Store also offers games, it's going to cause fragmentation in the Mac game space and be hurtful.Not to mention the Mac App Store only accepts self contained apps that are icons in the Application folder.  Steam doesn't care and offers packages also, so game devs are much freer to make more complex and better games for the Mac with Steam as the store.The Mac App Store, if any, will be quick solitaire like things, not actual games like on consoles and the PC.  It would be much better for Apple to refer game devs to Steam and to make the Game section of the Mac App Store download/open the Steam client.</text>

Looking at history and going back to the late 80's when computers we're just taking off there we're 1000's of junk titles. I remember buying work related apps and game apps that were just junk. Developers looking to quickly jump on the money wagon. But, over time, the weak died and the strong application developers survived. It's going to be the same here and in the iOS App store.So, I expect a mad rush in the beginning, but the junk Apps will fade off and the strong apps will survive. Like today with the iOS store, the popular Apps will float to the top and this will be a great distribution channel for Mac Developers.I see nothing but a good thing for all and it's exciting to see that iOS apps can be easily ported. Not all should and we will see junk, but again, as it matures, we will see more and better applications emerge.</text>

	<text>Don't understand the people here that are complaining that they have to pay again for the game if it gets ported to the Mac. First of all, it is a different platform (which requires some work) and second: Look at the price - its not like you pay $150 for iPad and than again $150 for the Mac - they are mostly under $5. Also: Do you expect if you buy a game for the Wii, that you get the same game title with basically the same game play for free for the DS? If you don't want to pay for the Mac Version - don't get it and use it on the platform you payed for.</text>
