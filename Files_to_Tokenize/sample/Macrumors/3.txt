	<text>On the first trading day of 2011, Apple's stock has jumped to a new high and broken through yet another psychological milestone by pushing past &#36;300 billion in market capitalization.  AAPL stock currently sits at nearly &#36;330 per share with a market cap of over &#36;302 billion.Apple set a series of market cap milestones last year,passing &#36;200 billionin early March,leapfrogging Wal-Martjust a few days later, andpassing Microsoftin late May to become the second largest U.S. company by market capitalization behind Exxon Mobil.  Apple continues to trail Exxon Mobil, which also had a strong performance in the latter half of 2010 and currently sits at a market cap of about &#36;368 billion.</text>

	<text>This is just scratching the surface. Lots more growth potential over the current decade.The alarm clock issue, by the way, CHANGES NOTHING.Apple still - as always - sets the standard.Even with Apple products, there have been bugs now and then. Compared to the also-rans, they've been few and far-between, and thankfully, the superior (with a capital S) User Experience across the board helps make up for the few niggles we do come across.Compared to the rest, all for all, Apple is a breath of fresh air in tech. They never cease to push the industry forward and show the way. Their success is well-deserved, in part because the company is run by a guy who actually cares about what he puts his name to and actually gives a damn about how everyday people should interact with tech.I invite the trolls to continue to ride the clock bug to the fullest. Because sadly, that's all they could find. It's usually bad for trolls on MR, and I don't mind letting them have their fun now and then, even if it's utterly laughable.</text>

	<text>I can't believe Exxon is still higher.  Maybe money normally that flowed to BP Oil went to them after that crisis.  For once, I would like to see Apple at the number #1 slot in this Market Cap category.The entire Apple story from the 70's to today would make a nice movie.</text>

Long term investing is something that many fail to subscribe to.There's no way in hell anyone could have guessed in 1996 that Apple would turn out this way because of the iPod/iPhone momentum. Nevertheless, congratulations to your luck and GREAT intuition. Was a good move to put your money into this company.</text>

Playing Blu-ray is not really that difficult. Playing Blu-ray while locking down the computer so that no hacker can copy the movies is a lot, lot harder and a major pain. And the penalties if hackers get in are stiff.</text>

I mean current goes out and your clocks stops. You get up and go where you have to go and move on. By no means is apple perfect but complaining about something where it doesnt work 2 days out of (i dont know if this is yearly problem unless they fix or just a 2011 Jan 1 and 2 problem) whatever it is.What was ridiculous was the antennae issue. But hey it was what it was. It was apples fault for having it and it was ours for now waiting for the review to buy it.Moving on congrats to apple on their performance. Hopefully they keep their customers and design in mind as they grow and grow. Even though it gets harder and harder to concentrate on individual customers/demographic due to the broadening of your user base.</text>

There were two 2 for 1 splits since 1996. 1996 was the first time I bought into Apple at around the same circa $25 price at the time.</text>

Particularly not since Jobs returned.Make a simplified lineup of great products and people will buy them.  That's the Apple of today.  And the Apple the haters love to hate (&quot;Where's my 5&quot;/7&quot;/12&quot; iPad???&quot;  &quot;Why can't Apple license their OS to other manufacturers???&quot;  &quot;Why, Dell gives me 8 billion customizable laptop configurations!&quot;  Etc.).</text>

And the penalties if hackers get in are stiff.We knowdowhat Steve thinks about Blu-ray.

Apple knew of the bug, had the ability to fix the bug and had the capacity to disseminate the fix via iTunes.What did they do? Nothing, and that is the ridiculous part here.It's an alarm. That's it. It's certainly no showstopper. An annoyance? Absolutely. Cause for artificial and inflated complaining because you're looking for something - anything at all - to ride against Apple because they've absolutely shellacked the competition in tech for years now?  Absolutely not. Sorry pal, Apple will *still* get special treatment because of everything else they've achieved and put into their products. I'm perfectly willing to overlook an annoying alarm bug if I get to run iOS on Apple hardware that is for the most part a standard-setting experience.Meanwhile . . . not only is Android already going the way of the old Windows Mobile in Google's race to the bottom along with the also-rans, but they appear to be living up to their always-in-beta reputation. Such a reputation is usually a bad thing, even worse when it comes to something malicious:http://www.phonedog.com/2010/12/31/a...ty-for-google/SMS is a persistent problem for Google anyway. I'll take an alarm bug over that any day.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byz3r0incthey need to do a 2-1 stock split so i can afford some of their stock...jeez... $300+ is way too high...A split would be nice but you can always use a deep in the money call as a stock replacement vehicle. Lower cost of entry, lower risk and the best way to play it is buying a call or two on the dips and sell when the stock regains it's footing.There are usually three of four such cycles per year. Please do research so you understand the play. I like to see a pullback of 20 points or more.I have made more quick money doing this and used the proceeds to diversify and build a larger APPL position.</text>

Diversify.I disagree.Being diversified has always seemed like a bad idea to me.I stick to tech stocks because I know tech.  Maybe I could have made money in mining stocks or other sectors, but I know very little about mining and just don't feel comfortable investing in stuff I'm not a master of.But tech - wow, when the analysts are full of beans, I can certainly tell when they are out to lunch, and I bet against these haters.Somewhere out there is a website that counts all the stupid anti-apple predictions - &quot;apple is going broke&quot; counter or something like that.  I always knew that those &quot;analysts&quot; were paid off to be negative about AAPL and I have been a continuous buyer of AAPL for 20 years.My tech only portfolio has losses and wins, but I can sleep at night knowing that my life savings is in AAPL - no problem.   With one caveat!  I do have StockTrac with push alarms to tell me when the stock moves.  But with an average price in the $40's I still come out a winner when TSHTF.So put all your eggs in one basket I say. It's safer than losing everything.Check the markets - everything is going up.  It's crashing upwards right now!  How can you pick a loser right now?   Just get out before the bubble busts, or pick a good stock like AAPL that will weather any storm.  If you diversify, you'll  possibly suffer losses throughout your portfolio.I just don't get what advantage being diversified really has provided the investor in the last 20 years.  I'd say nothing.Quote:Originally Posted byaussie_geekJust wait for a stock split - 3:1 and I'm in!!Buy now what you can, and when it splits 3:1 you'd have triple the shares worth the exact same dollar amount.</text>

I'd say nothing.Markets have been going up on cheap fed money. They've been printing money and buying their own bonds from dealers who then buy stocks.Big difference between this tech run and 2000 was we now have flash crashes with all the hft robots trading. They do most of the volume.I love apple and the stock does seem reasonably priced, but buying at the top of the market with gas prices so high,unemployment still near 10% and housing double dipping is just asking for it.During the big flash crash if you had a limit order in place, it wouldn't have helped because it dropped so fast and quick. Your stock would have been sold way lower than you wantedThe best way protect your apple stock profits is to buy protective puts. Or buy qid which is 2x the inverse NASDAQ 100. Apple is 20% of that index.</text>

	<text>Heres one side :Apple mania is a fad, it will not last. Every store is packed full of shoppers, new product releases, even upgrades cause over night line ups and waiting lists for months.Flawed product areas and awkward solutions are over looked.Its a classic fad, and greatly tied to a single person which in itself is highly risky.The companies people mock in this thread many once had similar runs, with even higher p/e .And the other view:BUT the health of Steve Jobs aside,currently no end seems to be in site for Apples run. The iPad 2 looks to sell even more than the iPad 1,  iPhone 5 will correct the perceived antenna flaw of the 4, new laptops will be thinner and with batteries that last longer than ever. The windows brand is tarnished and osx will continue to grow. Selling renting downloads or streams of movies will only grow. Add to that more revenue from iads and the new osx mac app store. Things can only get better, or so it seems.Surely everyone will be figuring this out and buying stock at even higher prices .... Until?</text>

THe more people that have a Macintosh computer, the more it is an appealing OS for developers to make applications for or port over applications (and do a *decent* job instead of a half ass job a lot of developers do. My vet still runs OS 8.6 and he runs a software that they finally bothered porting and half of it doesn't work on Mac and I know Quicken apparently did a poor port). The more software available, the more useful the computer.Therefore, yes, I do want to see the platforms I use become popular cause popularity means more stuff available for the platform I choose. And less compromise of &quot;Do I go with this platform that i like to use better but has little available for it?&quot; or &quot;Do i go with this platform that I hate using but I will have more available to use with it (Including a selection of apps that I can choose the best one rather than be forced to use one certain one cause that's the only one made for that platform)&quot;.I don't understand people who don't want Apple to become popular. Or maybe they just annoy me cause I like using Mac (and my iphone) and I'd love it to be more useful and have more choice of applications to use on it vs. limiting it cause there's no market to develop for it solely so some people can feel they're unique for using it.</text>
