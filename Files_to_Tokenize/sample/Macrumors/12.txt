	<text>The 2011 Consumer Electronics Show officially kicks off this week, and the press releases and events have started.   Here are a few interesting Apple-related products that have already appeared.  We'll provide limited CES coverage over the week.iHome AirplayiHome Audiohas unleashedmore informationabout their iW1 AirPlay wireless speaker system.  The wireless speaker supports Apple'sAirPlaytechnology to stream music throughout the house from iTunes.Using AirPlay, users can wirelessly stream music from iTunes, iPhone, iPad or iPod touch over Wi-Fi to the iHome iW1 speaker system and enjoy music in any room of the house. AirPlay requires iTunes 10.1 or later and iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 4.2 or later.The iW1 comes with a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery, allowing you to place it anywhere in the house.  Multiple speakers are supported to play music in several locations and it also doubles as an iPhone dock that allows local playback.Eye-Fi Direct ModeEye-Fi">announcedan upcoming "Direct Mode" for their Wi-Fi enabled storage cards that will allow you to transfer photos directly from your camera to your mobile device.With Direct Mode, photos taken with your digital camera can immediately be sent to your smartphone or tablet. They can be viewed, used with myriad apps on the device, or uploaded and shared.Eye-Fi cards are regular SD cards that fit into your digital camera, but also incorporates Wi-Fi to transfer your photos to your computer.   The Direct Mode will presumably bring this support to wirelessly send photos to your iPhone or iPad in realtime rather than to your computer.Fling Game Controller for iPadTenOneDesignannounced theirgame controlleraccessory for the iPad that allows you to place an analog stick directly on the screen.TouchArcadetook a first look at the device:The Fling is a cleverly designed device with two suction cups on one side connected to a plastic ring. Inside of the plastic ring is a spiral that suspends an electrically conductive joystick in the center. This spiral works like a spring, always returning the joystick to the center, and providing more resistance the closer you get to the edge of the plastic ring.....If you're playing a game with floating virtual joysticks like most dual stick shooters, all you've got to do is position it wherever is most comfortable to you, press down both suction cups, and you're ready to roll.Fling is expected to ship in late January and costs &#36;24.95 for one, and &#36;38.00 for a two-pack.</text>

	<text>I was hoping that my next digital camea would have built in WiFi rather that Eye-Fi cards!As for the game-controler, not sure if I like or hate this. There are a number of psudo-joystick controls on some iOS Apps and I really find them hard to use, so this may help. (But it defets the whole ethos of the iPad in a way.)</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bygoobothow does that sd card work anyhow?I am wondering the same thing. I am curious what kind of limitations it would have. The iPhone/iPad can't act as a Wi-Fi hotspot, so I have no clue how you would get the Eye-Fi card to connect up. It seems like it would be limited to APs that you programmed into the card and/or public APs.I don't know how it would work out in the middle of nowhere unless the Eye-Fi card could somehow act as a hotspot, but I doubt that's possible given the battery constraints, etc.It would be much better to just use bluetooth for this kind of thing. Oh well.</text>

It would have to connect to the card via WiFi, then transfer the files from it, then put the files in your library. It's perfectly doable. But does it break the rules? I doubt it.</text>

	<text>I bought some iHome speakers recently and was pleasantly suprised at the sound quality that came from them, and the portability with the built in battery made it a must own.  Bought one for my mom for Christmas, and it was so cool I ended up buying one for myself.The Airplay speakers look cool, but I'd still like something I can dock.  Since speakers w/ just music is more for longer uses that could drain the battery, rather than say airplay to put a YouTube video on the TV for somebody to watch real quick.</text>

	<text>That looks like an interesting controller. I'll be willing to give it a try. Tactile sensation in playing games is necessary for alot of shooter like Geometry Wars. I have the iPad and that game, and its cool. The controller is pretty good, but tactile sensation is missing. Seems to be reasonably priced also.- Cory Cowgill -</text>

I was going to get several of these and put them around the house.Personally I would strongly recommend saving your pennies and going for Sonos S5 all-in-one units at $399 each. I currently have two units controlled via the free iPad and iPhone controllers, happily streaming iTunes, internet Radio, Pandora content around my house - either both units playing the same material or separate etc. - and it's a revelation. Sound is great, flexibility is unbeatable, setup took all of 10 minutes. Sonos is one of the few companies out there with the same design/functionality ethos as Apple. It just works and works well.</text>

	<text>Whilst its a great concept the controller thing is ultimately a poor substitute for an actual physical controller.I got the other half an iPad for xmas and I had a blast on the games for it. I like the first person shooters etc but they are simply unplayable or have reduced functionality due to the fact that the ipad and iPhone are simply an uncomfortable platform to play the games on. Someone release a decent bluetooth controller and bring the App Store to ATV and voila a home console to play these games on. That coupled with Gamecenter might actually satisfy the casual gamer. At the moment its nothing more than frustration due to the control method. Its a shame because the games actually look quite good on the iPad.</text>

Not a difficult concept, you're just over complicating it in your mind.  Select the speaker in iTunes and stream to it, just as with airport express - just the airport bit is built into the speaker rather than being a separate box...</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bynelmatThey don't require a password - this is a one way communication, just as with airport express.  Not a difficult concept, you're just over complicating it in your mind.  Select the speaker in iTunes and stream to it, just as with airport express - just the airport bit is built into the speaker rather than being a separate box...It's definetely not one way communication, since the devices discovers each other. You'll never be able to stream to an Airport Express unless it's connected to the same network, either by joining it or being the one creating the network, and ofcourse, the same goes for every other device that uses Airplay. Airplay only works between compatible devices that are connected to the same WiFi network</text>

	<text>The controller solution is simple and it's 100% down to Apple to allow it.There is no reason on earth why they cannot make an external iController as a user option for games. As they do the plug in adaptors for camera cards.In any game, the developer can put a user option whether to use on screen controls or use the external iController.They would sell millions of them, and allow people to play many games properly on their iPad.Yes, some games are very suited to on screen controls. Other games are totally ruined and virtually unplayable without a real controller.It's up to Apple to give people the option.</text>

I only need audio but audio/video airplay would be nice for people with monitors in their vehicles.Man, I really want this, too.

I mean I understand that they connect via WiFi, but how the hell do the speakerstype inthe WiFi password and get passed the security without a screen and a keyboard??Based on the responses in this thread, there seems to be some confusion on how this works, myself included. The blurb about this new iHome does say you have to be on a wifi network, which makes me wonder as well about those dumb wifi/sharing passwords for such a speaker. Aside from that, I guess I was naively hopeful that this Airplay technology would eliminate the need to be on a wifi network; I'd hoped all you'd need was your iPhone/iPad and the speaker and nothing else. Oh, well.Quote:Originally Posted byiPhoneCollectorThey use their own invisible network. Not the wifi you have at your home. They wil work even if you don't have a wifi connection at home.I want to believe that, but doesn't the blurb say it requires wifiQuote:Originally Posted byVanillaPersonally I would strongly recommend saving your pennies and going for Sonos S5 all-in-one units at $399 each. I currently have two units controlled via the free iPad and iPhone controllers, happily streaming iTunes, internet Radio, Pandora content around my house - either both units playing the same material or separate etc. - and it's a revelation. Sound is great, flexibility is unbeatable, setup took all of 10 minutes. Sonos is one of the few companies out there with the same design/functionality ethos as Apple. It just works and works well.Because I'm such an admitted Apple fanboy, I've wanted to stay in the Apple ecosystem, and hoped Airplay would do that, but the more I learn about Airplay the more I think I'll go with Sonos one day.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byAstro7xI bought some iHome speakers recently and was pleasantly suprised at the sound quality that came from them, and the portability with the built in battery made it a must own.  Bought one for my mom for Christmas, and it was so cool I ended up buying one for myself.The Airplay speakers look cool, but I'd still like something I can dock.  Since speakers w/ just music is more for longer uses that could drain the battery, rather than say airplay to put a YouTube video on the TV for somebody to watch real quick.well there is a USB port on the back of that speaker. So if you had the iPhone dock, you could connect to the speaker and there you go. Looks like a really well made speaker, hopefully its not too high priced though.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byovrlrdI am wondering the same thing. I am curious what kind of limitations it would have. The iPhone/iPad can't act as a Wi-Fi hotspot, so I have no clue how you would get the Eye-Fi card to connect up. It seems like it would be limited to APs that you programmed into the card and/or public APs.I don't know how it would work out in the middle of nowhere unless the Eye-Fi card could somehow act as a hotspot, but I doubt that's possible given the battery constraints, etc.It would be much better to just use bluetooth for this kind of thing. Oh well.They actually have their service set up where the card sends the photos to an EyeFi service.  You then go to a web site (in advance) and tell it where to send any photos upon receipt - - Picasa web, Flickr, Facebook, a PC, etc etc.  On the PC you actually have an app that runs in the background and polls for photos.  I assume you'd have a similar app on the iPod/iPhone.  Because all the connections are outgoing to EyeFi's servers, there's no firewall issues.I tried out one of their products and the biggest issue for me was the programming of the chip for WiFi access points; in order to connect to an access point you had to put the chip into a PC and program the access point's settings.  The best setup for me was actually activating the access point in my phone; that way the chip would have a constant access point to connect to no matter where I was.</text>

I'd enjoy the minimalist-ness of that.The way I understand it, Airplay needs a wifi network, so if car companies built a wifi access point into the stereo to enable airplay, the iphone will attempt to use it to access the internet, but obviously won't have a connection, thus you won't be able to use any internet streaming, etc through your stereo since the iphone thinks it's on a traditional network.Get an A2DP enabled head unit. It's identical to airplay for audio.</text>

I mean I understand that they connect via WiFi, but how the hell do the speakers type in the WiFi password and get passed the security without a screen and a keyboard??Isn't the idea that compatible devices use AirPlay/AirTunes to kinda &quot;announce&quot; themselves on your network? I don't think they need to actually log in to your network - the speakers/stereo don't need to enter a password. Instead, they're using Bonjour to broadcast their availability - they say, &quot;hi, I'm here&quot; - and then you can choose to play music to the device from your computer or iPhone, etc., because the AirPlay software is looking for Airplay devices for you. Once you choose the device (via Airplay, iTunes, AirFoil, or whatever) from the list of available Airplay devices, then the connection is made. It's kinda like working with a networked printer - the printer doesn't necessarily have to enter a password, it's simply available as a resource anyone on the network can print to - but the computer you're printing from does have to be logged onto the network, if the printer is only being made available over a secure local network.I'm not entirely explaining this right, but I think that's the general idea. With an Ethernet/LAN connection this would be easy - should be plug-and-play, adding Airplay speakers just like you'd plug a printer in. With WiFi I'm not so sure - some Airplay devices may need to be configured/logged-in with your network using software on your computer or iOS device before being used the first time; or it may need to be allowed/paired with your other devices, kinda like how you associate Bluetooth headphones and wireless mice, etc., with a specific phone or computer.I'm wondering about the opposite direction of this - if a password isn't required to connect to the device, is it possible you could connect to it even if you're not the device's owner. E.g. Could you prank your neighbor by streaming music from your house to their new iHome speakers without them knowing where the music was coming from</text>
