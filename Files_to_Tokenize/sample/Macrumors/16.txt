	<text>According toThe Loop, Apple is apparently planning toopen the Mac App Storeat noon Eastern Time tomorrow, bringing a variation of the company's integrated application purchasing system for iOS to the Mac OS X platform.The Mac App Store will officially launch on January 6, but nobody has been able to nail down a time when the service will be publicly available.According to my sources, the Mac App Store will be available at 12:00 pm (noon) ET on Thursday. That puts it at about 9:00 am PT where Apple is headquartered in Cupertino, Calif.The Loop's Jim Dalrymple is a veteran Apple-focused journalist who early last monthaccurately claimedthat the Mac App Store would launch in January, despite several rumors circulating at the time claiming that Apple would open the store before the holidays.Just yesterday,we notedthat several high-profile iOS developers are bringing Mac versions of their applications to the Mac App Store in the initial wave, generally opting to price their offering inline with the corresponding iOS versions.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byfelt.For sure, I always forget if I'm supposed to drag the app to my app folder to install it or shoot myself in the face.Come on, atlest 100 years ago before the 1st App Store people would need read magazines, talk to friends and colleges, google search, etc... to even find applications.  Then they would have to find the part of the site that says, &quot;ON SALE, BUY NOW!!!!&quot; in hard to find, large, bright colors.  ONLY THEN would they user be stuck with trying to figure out if they should drag the application to the shortcut to Applications that is labeled &quot;drag here&quot; or shoot themselves in the face.  Now all a user has to do is open App Store an search for a topic!</text>

	<text>Wouldn't surprise me if the roll-out is staggered tomorrow, different times for different countries. I suspect there will be a lot of traffic, and they may want to have time to monitor the servers as they come up to speed.Did I miss an article somewhere - but is Apple's new server farm in South Carolina hosting this new App Store?</text>

	<text>Apple should start download of the Mac Apps Store (or 10.6.6 if it's in there) right now..... Or else they will overwhelm their servers with all the downloads for it AND the apps...Even if it's just Mac Apps (meaning not as a many downloads as with iOS apps) and with a new data farm -or whatever it's called- I don't think it's prudent.</text>

	<text>I hope app developers continue to release &quot;stand-alone&quot; versions of Apps in addition to using the app store.Reason: lab and corporate environments.In a lab environment you might have 50 machines, all using the same OS install image and logged into by different users. In order to install the same software on all of them, there can't be any DRM that ties an installation to a specific serial number.As neat as it would be to see something like Adium in the app store, this will break installing it on large numbers of computers.</text>

	<text>Cool, can't wait.  I'm prolly just going to be sitting on the sidelines eating popcorn.  Here's hoping that this app store doesn't get filled-up with fart apps and silly games.  I dunno, going by Apple's list of restrictions, I doubt the MAS is going to sell any applications that interests me (or that I don't already own).  Besides, if I really needed a specific program, wouldn't I have just downloaded it days to months ago (or owned it already)?  It's not like this is a completely new platform.  Hasn't the stuff that's going to be offered tomorrow already been available from days to years?</text>

That just makes no sense.Maybe he's afraid the Mac App Store will become theonlyplace to Mac apps.  If that's the case, lots of people who use professional apps (like Adobe apps) will be out of luck.  While I can see the possibility of Apple only doing this, it's just that: aPOSSIBILITY.Or, maybe he just doesn't like the app store for no particular reason.  Whatever.</text>

	<text>The Mac App Store requires 10.6.6 doesn't it?At least that's what I thought.  Can't remember a OS update in the morning, gotta be this afternoon. I'm sure they want those apps selling asap tomorrow!</text>

	<text>I think this is going to be amazingly convenient! For iLife, all I want is iPhoto and iMovie, done for $20.  For iWork, can't wait for an update to Pages.  Done $10.  Think about all the software we'd like to try, but don't know where to look or compare or see what other's have said.  I'm a huge fan of the evals in iTunes.iWork better be updated though! This will be hugely successful!Also, for the Greenies in the group, much better for the environment, less packaging, paper etc...Coachingguy</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byx13gameri hope this will go down as apples biggest flopsOn the contrary, I can see this as another success story. The app store is what propelled the iPhone and the the iPad successes. The Mac line has always languished. Yes year over year they increase market share but not to the degree of the portable devices. One holdback has always been the limited variety of software (especially business Apps) not to mention where to find it. This now makes it easier for those looking to switch or jump on the mac bandwagon. It is beneficial to those past Mac users in that the development pool should increase as well.I see a nice gain in Mac sales this year. I would think when Lion is released that will propel this even more.</text>

	<text>For all those scoffing at the idea of Mac Apps being difficult to install now, let's just review the possible options:1. Download the DMG, double-click to mount (if not auto-mounted).  Drag app to Applications folder (sometimes via a provided alias, but usually not), then unmount Disk Image and delete DMG file.  Ease of use: Good.  Intuitiveness: Not so good (especially for users coming from Windows).  I can't even count the number of times I've seen someone running Skype or Firefox from the disk image every time, and then they trash the dmg file at some point thinking it's just a useless extra, and suddenly their app doesn't work any more.  It's not a bad method, but it doesn't make sense unless there's good instructions in the download (some developers do a good job here, many don't).2. Download the DMG, double-click to mount (if not auto-mounted).  Double-click installer, follow directions.  Ease of use: Good.  Intuitiveness: Good.  I think this is the best option currently, though of course the argument is that an installer is overkill for most apps.3. Download a zip file, double-click to decompress, then drag resulting app to the Applications folder.  Ease of use: Good.  Intuitiveness: Fair.  While this doesn't have the issues of the similar DMG method, it still doesn't automatically result in the app being installed correctly into the users Applications folder.  Doesn't affect all apps, but it's still good practice for them to be there.4.  Purchase on disk, bring home, place in disk drive, run installer.  Ease of use: Fair (only because of inconvenience of going to the store to purchase actual disk).  Intuitiveness: Varies, but usually good.  Adobe's apps get a poor rating in this regard, however, as their installer is a layer or two deep into the disk.So while none of these are exceptionally difficult, the array of options (and I'm sure I missed a few) makes it a confusing process for users who are not tech-savvy, which is by far the majority of the population, and also the target market for this sort of product.  The Mac App Store simplifies all of these steps into a simple click to install.jW</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bykas23Cool, can't wait.  I'm prolly just going to be sitting on the sidelines eating popcorn.  Here's hoping that this app store doesn't get filled-up with fart apps and silly games.  I dunno, going by Apple's list of restrictions, I doubt the MAS is going to sell any applications that interests me (or that I don't already own).  Besides, if I really needed a specific program, wouldn't I have just downloaded it days to months ago (or owned it already)?  It's not like this is a completely new platform.  Hasn't the stuff that's going to be offered tomorrow already been available from days to years?Hit the nail right on the head. I think the same type of people who will get the most use out of this are the same people who bought the 13&quot; MBP simply because it said &quot;Pro&quot; instead of the regular Macbook (every hipster ever).I think it's cool and everything, but every serious user has already got a source for those things. I'm excited just live everyone else because of the potential, but in practicality I feel like this will have absolutely 0 effect on the way I go about my business. I do know one thing though, I'm not looking forward to answering questions about where Pages citation manager is.As for the people who are saying this is the end to piracy, let me just say that I have never met anyone at my university who pays for software, and I'm a 4th year computing student who volunteers at the campus computing repair store. I've never even seen anyone buy software. However, everyone I know has Office/iWork etc. This will do nothing to stop piracy, if people don't want to pay, they're not going to pay.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byCameront9To be fair, if you're coming from Windows and are used to installers, mounting a disc image and dragging the app to your app folder is confusing, as is the fact that after you install you have to dismount the disk image AND throw the image away.This. Try explaining to a novice Mac user what a &quot;virtual volume&quot; is. Not all apps contained in DMGs tell you to drag it to the App folder, and will act wonky/not work if launched from within the DMG. Some apps are smart and can tell if they're in the DMG, offering to move itself to the App folder for you. Unfortunately this is a rare feature.Not to mention, doing all of that is just plain cumbersome. The faster DMGs die the better.Quote:Originally Posted byx13gamerThe limit of 5 authorized computers?There is no such limit. It's all the Macs that you own. But I'd argue that the DRM will actually make iteasierto pirate mac software for the sole reason that everything on the Mac store will be using the same DRM. If you crack one, you can crack them all. In fact, it'salready been cracked.</text>

Currently, that's limited to 5 computers.  So unless they change something, it's only on up to 5 computers.jW</text>

It still simplifies the process, by whichever means you attribute it to.  I personally will continue to download and purchase software via whatever method I need to in order to get the right tool for me, whether that's through the Mac App Store or elsewhere, but for the novice user, this is a godsend.jW</text>

The app store still has it's uses (consolidated payments, licensing, search, etc) but as far as ease-of-installation goes, we're not really gaining anything.On the other hand, maybe this will entice creators of these &quot;non-consolidated apps&quot; to start packaging them differently so that they can make it into the app store.</text>

	<text>Why?1. The reviews like the apps in the itunes store for iOS.  I use them heavily to determine if an app is worth buying.  Especially since the many versions of like apps.2. Will be able to buy piece meal. I need home and business version of Word, Excel (no use for powerpoint nor outlook [especially since outlook no longer syncs with your iOS devices].  Keynote is good but I am actually thinking of using ProPresenter - due to the availability of bibles, etc). I need Pages 11, but have no use for Numbers.  I need the new iMovie; the rest in iLife 09 suits me fine.3. A number of rumors point to iOS developers porting their apps over to the mac.  would be really nice if some of the ipad apps I have come to the mac and have ease of syncing data (USB, itunes) rather than using wifi.  wifi is ok if you have small amounts of data; but moving 12gb of OneNote notebooks to mobilenoter over wifi took about 10 hrs.  Some of the iOS apps I have, I would really love on my mac...Don't tell me about dropbox.  Already have it and use it - but it really does nothing for apps with specialized data structure that can't just be imported...4. Looking forward to the updates.  Auto-install like iOS apps, and more frequent updates that add features.5. Hopes for easier un-install of apps, that do not leave fragments of itself around.7. No more googling for hours just to find something I hope is available for a specific need.  Now, just hit the apps store and see what's new, hot, noteworthy.Unlike the current iOS app store, I hope they have better keyword searching.  Amazing how I type in web editor, get a bunch of results - only to find more website editing apps when searching for something else (because web or editor was not in the name).</text>

That is, they will keep selling it as a package installer (with all office apps) through their own retail channels.The reasons are simple:A) They don't need the distribution, people who need office already know where to get itB) They won't need to rewrite any of their code to comply with Apple's mac app store guidelinesC) And of course,the biggie, they won't need to give apple a commissionThe same goes for Adobe and their suite of products.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byMalFor all those scoffing at the idea of Mac Apps being difficult to install now, let's just review the possible options:1. Download the DMG, double-click to mount (if not auto-mounted).  Drag app to Applications folder (sometimes via a provided alias, but usually not), then unmount Disk Image and delete DMG file.  Ease of use: Good.  Intuitiveness: Not so good (especially for users coming from Windows).  I can't even count the number of times I've seen someone running Skype or Firefox from the disk image every time, and then they trash the dmg file at some point thinking it's just a useless extra, and suddenly their app doesn't work any more.  It's not a bad method, but it doesn't make sense unless there's good instructions in the download (some developers do a good job here, many don't).2. Download the DMG, double-click to mount (if not auto-mounted).  Double-click installer, follow directions.  Ease of use: Good.  Intuitiveness: Good.  I think this is the best option currently, though of course the argument is that an installer is overkill for most apps.3. Download a zip file, double-click to decompress, then drag resulting app to the Applications folder.  Ease of use: Good.  Intuitiveness: Fair.  While this doesn't have the issues of the similar DMG method, it still doesn't automatically result in the app being installed correctly into the users Applications folder.  Doesn't affect all apps, but it's still good practice for them to be there.4.  Purchase on disk, bring home, place in disk drive, run installer.  Ease of use: Fair (only because of inconvenience of going to the store to purchase actual disk).  Intuitiveness: Varies, but usually good.  Adobe's apps get a poor rating in this regard, however, as their installer is a layer or two deep into the disk.So while none of these are exceptionally difficult, the array of options (and I'm sure I missed a few) makes it a confusing process for users who are not tech-savvy, which is by far the majority of the population, and also the target market for this sort of product.  The Mac App Store simplifies all of these steps into a simple click to install.jWThis is a good summary.  Nicely done.My measure of how easy something is on the Mac is whether I can talk my wife through the process, and then whether the process has 'stuck' so that she can do it again on her own.  Applications installations rank as &quot;moderately difficult&quot; on this scale.She is no dummy, and she's not afraid of technology.... she doesn't like it for it's own sake.  It's not fun, to her.  There are several different ways (as listed above) and unless there is good instructions (rare) you need toknowwhich method to use, and then what you need to do to clean up afterwards.The MAS should make things a lot easier.  I'll post back when I've found an application for my wife to install.</text>

It was a device stuck in two minds, and as such did nothing particularly well. It was no surprise when consumers ignored Apple's device for the Nintendo 64 and the Sony PlayStation.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bygorjanI find it irritating that all apps leave pref-files and folders after being uninstalled. It's also bad that some apps can be uninstalled by dragging to the trash while others have uninstallers.There are some bad things with Windows, but the add/remove programs uninstaller isn't one of them. :PI have to wholeheartedly disagree. The Add/Remove programs is one of the things wrong with Windows. See, it doesn't matter on the Mac OS if preference files are left behind, it doesn't affect performance. On Windows, add/remove programs leaves files on the system and the Registry ends up getting clogged up with errors as usual and the system gets highly affected leaving the user no alternative but to use Registry cleaning software which is PITA. No matter which way you look at it, installing/uninstalling apps has always been much easier than anything on Windows, and Windows 7 didn't make it any better.</text>

I know many hold-outs not using the mac versions, due to not being able to buy separately.  The cost is the main factor.  In the Windows world, I can pick up the office apps I need separately - and not have to pay over $500 for the Office Professional Plus (used to be ultimate).  The most it would cost me is $200-$300.  I think on the mac world, they could sell Word for $79 and Excel for $79 and still sell more copies of those individually than they are getting for the whole suite.  Most people cannot justify the cost of a legal copy of Windows OS only for 1 or 2 applications.  I still have XP just because of OneNote.  And yes MS prices are bloated - especially when you can buy professional versions of the OS, and office for $10 at most colleges (provided you work there or are a student - or know someone who is either).People would buy it that way more - ie no wasted disk space for apps they were not using.  $158 for the apps I would use, verses $199 (or more) for a whole bunch of apps I would not use is easier on my wallet.  If I want to comply with licensing terms, I can't use Home and Student - due to my free lance, non-profit/church work, or when I take work home to get a project finished...</text>

However, this will be a bad business move as it will alienate the more professional users, IMO.  Especially considering even xCode wouldn't meet the requirements, which is required to make the programs that go in the app store.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byKnightWRXAnd why were you downloading cracked apps with the lack of an app store ?  The fact is, most people don't want to pay for the applications they pirate.  This isn't going to change the fact you need to pay.Agreed, but price is always a barrier. Early indications are that the Mac App Store will offer generally lower prices.As others have mentioned the store will also offer the choice of purchasing just one app from a suite. That's akin to selling individual songs instead of just selling albums, something that has worked very well from the consumer perspective.Another factor driving piracy is the receipt of files from other computer users, particularly those on Windows who assume everyone has whatever software they used to create the content.Almost all the support calls I get from my parents are about email attachments or links that they can't view: Word docs, photos packaged as PowerPoint presentations, attachments that require Silverlight, photos in Picassa that require a Google ID, etc.An easy to use, relatively safe and inexpensive place to get software would allow many people to solve their compatibility problems without resorting to piracy.</text>

	<text>I find the idea of a unified application update/management interface to be the best part about all this - package managers are brilliant under Linux for exactly this reason.For a good majority of Mac users who aren't using professional software this could end up being the only place they get apps.  It might also sell a few more copies of iWork, especially since they're selling it piecemeal and a fair bit cheaper than Office.Interesting times ahead, at any rate.</text>

	<text>Quote:1996 -- Apple PippinWith all of Apple's recent home runs, it's sometimes easy to forget that the company isn't infallible -- everyone have their fair share of embarrassing flops, after all. And Pippin was one of Apple's.For some inexplicable reason, Apple looked to enter the video game market in 1996, launching a collaboration with toy-maker Bandai that could play games and was also an inexpensive network computer. It was a device stuck in two minds, and as such did nothing particularly well. It was no surprise when consumers ignored Apple's device for the Nintendo 64 and the Sony PlayStation.Quote:After losing a power struggle with the board of directors in 1984, Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher education and business markets. Apple's subsequent 1996 buyout of NeXT brought Jobs back to the company he co-founded, and he has served as its CEO since 1997.1983 - Lisa (as far as I know Jobs was ahead of Macintosh program and not Lisa)1984 - Jobs resigned1993 - Newton1996 - Pippin1997 - Jobs is back as Apple CEO</text>

I also expect that other developers will reduce their pricing, considering the more customers they may get through the App Store and the competition that may derive from it. However, I do not think that we will get to see many big applications with low prices &ndash; but who would honestly expect that?I also do not agree with your view on many iOS apps. I actually enjoy your so called 'information catalogues' for the simple reason that they are often quicker and more efficient, in my opinion. But do you really expect to see many of those kind of applications on the Mac? I seriously doubt it.</text>

Useless junk to fill up the Application folder.  Just use bookmarks in your browser instead or better yet, Google the information.  I don't need an app to give me drink recipes or an app to find a Tim Horton's location or an app to browse items on Amazon, I can just go to the websites and do it and with a Mac, the experience will probably be better.Quote:Originally Posted byKALLTBut do you really expect to see many of those kind of applications on the Mac?

Go re-read my original response and the post I was responding to.Apps only check for updates when you open them (some of them), and not all of them do a great job on that. So if you want to get all your apps up to date, say, after returning from a vacation, it's much simpler to look at App Store application and see if you are up to date or not, instead of opening hundreds of apps one by one and checking if anyone pops up a &quot;update me&quot; window.I hope it's clear now why App Store is a major convenience for keeping apps to date.</text>

	<text>Hmm the apps seem a bit pricey (e.g. Angry Birds at 50% off is $5.99aud vs. $1.19 for the iPhone version) considering it's the exact same game as before just for a Mac rather than iPhone. And yes I'm an Angry Birds fan but from the developer's description, without further elaboration or an independent review, I think I can live without the &quot;unique enhancements, not available in the mobile version&quot;.I did download Solitaire Greatest Hits for my Mum. It'll be good to get some good/decent/cheap/free games in an easy/convenient manner. And yay it lets me use iTunes money (which you can get on sale at a discount anyway).For those who are wondering, downloaded apps go straight to your dock... hmm... it's going to get cluttered!</text>

That being said, if you go to &quot;top free games&quot;, there's only one option (Solitaire)! We'll have to wait and see if this kicks off over time!Here's a poor cameraphone screenshot:(note: I do know how to take screenshots in Mac, but for my less informed friends on Facebook, I prefer to take a photo with my phone showing the Macbook itself)</text>

	<text>Just a few quick reactions:Looks great! Nice to see a lot of apps I use regularly on the app store and look forward to finding new ones.I thought there were not supposed to be any &quot;lite/trial&quot; versions of apps in the store, yet I ran into this:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/booxt...06421537?mt=12andhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/booxt...05398062?mt=12, what are the rules Apple?The most exciting part of it for me is the licensing model tied to the account not the computer which makes software cheaper for multi-Mac households.EDIT: Works out great for iLife. $45 for the three updated apps instead of $79 for the family pack. Awesome. Plus Aperture for $79.99?B</text>

It'll be good to get some good/decent/cheap/free games in an easy/convenient manner. And yay it lets me use iTunes money (which you can get on sale at a discount anyway).For those who are wondering, downloaded apps go straight to your dock... hmm...it's going to get cluttered!Can't you just drag them into your applications folder, or simply drag them off the dock?</text>

That's what you need to be focusing on, not the iPhone prices which, frankly, got dragged into a race to the bottom which is great for the consumer but terrible for the developer.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byaristobratHmm, Aperture is $79.99 instead of $199.99.  That's a lot less pricey?Good point. I'm really only comparing it with things which I know whereas I have no idea about pricing for applications like Aperture. It makes sense that the download-model should be cheaper than buying in a store or whatever the previous option was.I know I'm cheap, but I hope there are more cheap/low priced apps in the future. That's the marvel of the App Store on the iPhone! Less than the cost of a can of Coca Cola... may as well download!Quote:Originally Posted bysmiddlehurstAnd how much, pray, is theiPadversion? That's what you need to be focusing on, not the iPhone prices which, frankly, got dragged into a race to the bottom which is great for the consumer but terrible for the developer. Sure everyone will be looking to avoid that situation with their apps if they possibly can.Again good point. I guess I should compare there as it's probably a fairer/more realistic comparison- but as a non-iPad owner, I've never really had a need to or considered looking at the iPad prices. I'm calling this debate based on a simple end-user's perspective. I'm a new(ish) Mac fan, love my iPhone and my apps, bought the Macbook, downloaded this new App Store, but am amazed at how different the prices are.</text>

Surely there would be ways of doing this within the program itself I guess. The only other rationale is it forces the user to think before they 'install' the application rather than allowing things to install themselves on their own without the user realising that stuff is filling up their hard drives *shrugs*</text>

Sure everyone will be looking to avoid that situation with their apps if they possibly can.Given the reasonable prices and lenient licensing for the more polished apps (like the ones from Apple), and the reaction that may iPhone apps are more expensive, I hope this ends up being a renormalization to the middle. Fewer &gt; $100 apps, but also fewer $0.99 apps.B</text>

The original post I was replying to said the Mac App Store solved the problem about remembering what an app is called.  It doesn't, you still need to remember the icon/app name in order to USE it.</text>
