	<text>RazorianFlyhas outed a screenshot of the Mac App Store which shows an official Mac twitter client.Were pleased to announce we have an exclusive look at the next version of Tweetie (Twitter) for Mac, version 2.0. While we cant go into too much detail, just know that Twitter for Mac version 2.0 will launch with the Mac App Store, tomorrow.The release should look familiar to fans ofAtebits'sTweetie for Mac. The future of Tweetie had been in question after Twitter acquired the developer back inMay.  The primary reason for the acquisition had been for Tweetie for iPhone, but it seems they have now rebranded Tweetie as the official Twitter client for Mac.The Mac App Store is expected to launch at noon eastern on Thursday, Jan 6th.</text>

I can see myself re-buying upgrades to apps I've already purchased on the same platform.Here's one example:http://realmacsoftware.com/blog/mac-app-store-pricingThey're cutting the price of RapidWeaver 5 to $39.99 for the Mac App Store &quot;for a limited time,&quot; to let 4.0 owners have an upgrade price. I imagine that will be the most popular way. Previous owners get a reduced upgrade price + it's a launch sale.</text>

The differences?1. Central location to buy the apps from.2. Apps must have a new way to install so the App Store can handle the install process, no more .dmg files sitting in your download folder on the desktop.3. Apps must be allowed to install on any number of machines as long as they share the same iTunes user id.4. Apps must be approved by Apple for content and various other concerns.That's it, these are the same apps as you bought before just in a new way. For example, RealMac's RapidWeaver, a full up Mac OS X HTML builder will be on the store tomorrow. Twitter for Mac (formely Tweetie for Mac) will be on the store tomorrow, it too is and was a full Mac OS X app.</text>

In Lion, the green Zoom button is being re-purposed to provide one-click access to anoptionalFull Screen interface that developers canchooseto implement for their apps (a la iPhoto '11).</text>

	<text>Frankly, I was hoping Apple would make RSS, Twitter, and if we must Facebook&hellip; all tabs in Mail.Sure it risks turning Mail into being everything to everyone like iTunes, but it would contain the 'social' stuff to a manageable window on the world, instead of an all attention consuming app, like tweetdeck, for example.It would be nice if Mail became extensible and we could add the tabs we want.Call me old fashioned, but I don't see 'social' consuming more of my total day than email did on its own before.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byCristobalHuetYou obviously know nothing of Tweetie and its development history.Thanks for the response; and to a point you are correct. I know it's the 3rd party client that was bought by Twitter themselves to be turned into the official client, beyond that I couldn't care less as I use Twitter maybe once a year (for MR's WWDC update tweets). Beyond that I can't stand Twitter so know no more of Tweetie than this.Anyway, I digress. You haven't answered my question; why does another Twitter client, official or not, supposedly highlight the benefits of the new App Store? As has been pointed out, a Twitter client does very little / nothing that can't be achieved in a standard browser anyway.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byThe GeneralWhat did you expect? Photoshop for $4.99?No, but based on the iOS App Store I would have thought the talking points would have been independent or lesser known software which is a benefit to the potential App Store customer than another Twitter client which does very little than a browser window pointed at Twitter's website does.The benefit of the iOS App Store to developers is the ability to have your app, once approved, available to millions of potential customers in massively disproportionate fashion to that which would otherwise be by promoting it through traditional channels (SEO, software bundles etc). The benefit to users is finding this software with minimal effort. Apple's website has previously had some excellent &quot;Staff Picks&quot; recommendations of smaller software houses' products with links to the developer's website, but they were often hard to find.I'm not seeing how Twitter's official client makes any real difference to a user, I would have expected more singing and dancing about software which was previously a relatively unknown Staff Pick but likely to do really well with the new distribution channel of the App Store.</text>

It works great already using an iPhone + iPad combo, and I can't wait to turn it up a notch and play it using my iPhone + iMac. Should be awesome!</text>

	<text>How I see the future of computing:You no longer do 90% of your things in the browser, you instead have Apps (clients) for things such as Twitter and Facebook, with built-in notification systems so you don't have to &quot;check your Facebook&quot; all the time. It's also native, not &quot;limited in-the-browser&quot;, so you can benefit from transitions and system optimizations. Also, the interface can look more Mac-like on Macs, and more Windows-like on PCs, since they would have different clients.Instead of Chrome OS, which forces everything such as text editing into the browser, I think everything that's in the browser should go native. That way, you would get much better performance and you would not have to wait for the interface to load each time, since it's on your hard drive, making loading times much shorter.I'm hoping that the App Store will allow for this to happen.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bywovelWell he both misunderstands the app store and make stuff up, so your confusion is understandable.Partly true, but the guy was right about one thing: It -- IS -- a requirement for AppStore applications to support a full screen mode. Without a full screen mode, Apple won't accept the app.For some apps, like Scrivener, Word, Pages or Aperture, a full screen mode makes perfect sense. However, for a stupid little thing like a Twitter app, it's ridiculous to demand it. But when you look at this &quot;Mission Control&quot; thing, it becomes rather obvious why applications will need a full screen mode -- Mission Control wouldn't work well without full screen apps.</text>

	<text>I can't wait. I'm very enthusiastic about the Mac App Store. I could use more &quot;cheap&quot; utility apps for Mac and the App Store will provide that and more. It will likely also increase the interest for developers to develop for Mac, which is also good Apple and Mac OS.I also like the idea of twitter, facebook and RSS apps.

As has been pointed out, a Twitter client does very little / nothing that can't be achieved in a standard browser anyway.It's not supposed to 'highlight the benefits of the new App Store' - the story is about the release of a new version of Tweetie. The information about the App Store is secondary.Steve</text>

	<text>Eh, it's alright.  Thing I really don't like is when you click the little blue tweet bird in the menu bar it automatically takes you to the top of your feed not the spot where you left off.  You actually have to use the icon in the dock to pick up where you left off.  Kinda annoying.It's better than the old Tweetie but I still prefer Kiwi on OS X.I do like what Loren did with the version for the iPad.</text>
