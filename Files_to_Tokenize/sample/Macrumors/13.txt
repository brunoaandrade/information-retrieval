	<text>With cases claimed to be for the next-generation iPad appearing over the past few weeks, observers have beenexaminingthe cases in detail in their attempts to get an idea of how the second generation of Apple's tablet will differ from the original version.  Based on those cases, it has been noted that the next-generation iPad appears to be slightly thinner than the current model and carries tapered edges more akin to the iPod touch than the current version's flat sides and rounded back.Comparison of current iPad (top) and mockup of claimed next-generation iPad (bottom)Asnoted byEngadget, however, one case manufacturer exhibiting its wares at CES has taken things one step further in aiding our visualization of the next-generation iPad by putting together a physical mockup of the device made out of machined aluminum.It [the case] was so intriguing that we asked to put our own iPad inside, which is when we were told it wouldn't fit, since the case was designed for the next iPad. Indeed, the mockup that we found inside the case was a tad bit slimmer than the first-gen iPad, with a taper leading to the edges that reminds us of the iPod touch, and a home button positioned nearer the bottom edge. We found all the typical cutouts on the case, and their mirror on the machined mockup, including a large square for the speaker.The rumored physical details of the next-generation iPad of course depend on the case mockups being based on accurate information, although such details have generally been fairly accurate in the past as the case manufacturers have been able to obtain advance design information through leaks in Apple's supply chain.  A number of the claimed cases have beenpulledsince their existence was made public, possibly suggesting that Apple has been stepping in to limit access to accurate details of its future products.Aluminum mockup of claimed next-generation iPad (rear view)</text>

	<text>So do these case manufacturers actually know any information, or are they guessing based off of the rumors so they can have a case ready at launch? It seems like if Apple actually gave them information they wouldn't be allowed to show off things like this.</text>

Not from Cupertino.Quote:Originally Posted byeawmp1BFD - I care more about the specs than the form factor.Doesn't the form-factor point to changes in relevant specs?  Thinking specifically about cameras.  Other specs are meaningless in an Apple tablet.  I couldn't care less about the processor or RAM.  Storage, maybe.  Though I've never gotten closed to filling my 32GB iPad.</text>

	<text>not really sure the mockup is the real thing.Apple is a lot about usability, and I doubt that these thin edges are convinient to hold; especially with one hand only.cases might have been removed from alibaba by apple even if they are not the real thing. after all they were posing to be for something (so far) non existing.</text>

It seems like if Apple actually gave them information they wouldn't be allowed to show off things like this.The article said these things happen because of leaks in Apple's supply chain... so presumably Foxconn workers just grab a shell off the production line and sell it for more than they'd get paid in a year.Seeing as there's no benefit for Apple to allow case manufacturers to have cases ready for launch, I doubt they'd do it, and if they did, it would be only to the higher profile case manufacturers, but this must not happen as usually it will be at least a few weeks before those companies come out with cases after a new product release.I wouldn't mind hearing a few more rumours about what'sinsidethe iPad 2. Apple don't often disappoint me with there designs.</text>

	<text>I passed on the first version of the iPad (just like I did on the first version of the iPhone).  As great as the iPad seemed on some levels, it underwhelmed in comparison to the iPhone 4 in almost all features other than size.I really look forward to seeing this version - and buying it.  That, and one day a Macbook Air.  My Macbook Pro feels heavy and clunky lately.  Changing times.</text>

	<text>Crumbs from the table of knowledge.I am damn interested to finally find the specs of the actual hardware, INSIDE.  Sometimes Apple tosses a zinger and a next gen is a delightful leap upward in function.  Let's hope iPad2 will be a nice little budge upward in processing/resolution/memory.The odd &quot;low end iMac&quot; rumor from last month is still vexing me.  It might have been a complete red herring, but it would be cool to see a stripped down iMac.</text>

	<text>That would be design wise a step backward ... looks like a blown up iPhone 3G(S) - don't think they will use the 'old' iPhone 3 design for the new iPad. And as mentioned by others, don't think this design of the edges would be very usable for devices bigger than the iPhone.</text>

	<text>I take this with a grain of salt. It's just a mock up from a vendor who got specs from a 3rd party and no knowledge of the real product. I'm sure when we see the real thing, it will look much more slick.Good way for them to get attention at CES though.</text>

	<text>I hope that is the shape of the next one because a flat back would be nice. The current one doesn't wobble a lot but it is just enough to be annoying.I'm still hoping for an SD card slot though so I don't have to carry around the camera connection kit dongle all the time. Of course, I won't really care about it unless they improve the photo app in terms of organization.</text>

Do you actually use your iPad while its sitting on a table?  I know I never have.  That totally defeats the purpose of a tablet, and its not very ergonomic.</text>

	<text>Is it just me or do the two images on this story not seem to match??? The top looks like a Black back and the bottom show a more squared off aluminum back? Or I'm I just not seeing this right?Ahhh.... does not matter.. it's a 3rd party mock up who is guessing anyway.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bySmall White CarI'm curious who, exactly, &quot;fears&quot; an iPad with curved edges.While not &quot;fears&quot; exactly, it's kinda annoying to have a curved back on a device which is often set and used on a table. My iPad kinda rocks around a bit when touch-typing on it; would rather it have a flat back so it stays flat when I lay it flat.The chromed surface has a similar problem: sliding. While the iPad 1's surface is pretty darned smooth, it is textured just enough to provide at least a little friction for holding.Put an iPod Touch on a table and start typing, and it will start flopping and sliding around. It's not made for such use; it's made to be held, with fingers wrapped around two sides, and interacted with for a few seconds at a time.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byAppleGoddessStill think iPhone 3was much nicer looking...I think the 3G/S with its curved back and sides sits more nicely in the hand than the angular iPhone 4. But the shiny plastic body is cheap-looking compared to aluminum or glass. Overall it's a toss up. I think the OG iPhone had the best-looking materials, reception-be-damned, and the 3G had the nicest shape.However in terms of Apple's design progression, this is something of a non-sequitur. Not that a curved aluminum body couldn't be nice, but this mockup just looks quick n' dirty.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byPopeye206The top looks like a Black back and the bottom show a more squared off aluminum back? Or I'm I just not seeing this right?You're just not seeing this right.That's a cleverness of Ive's design: by curving the back at a very steep angle, the device looks a lot thinner than it really is. When you do catch a glimpse of the back at an angle, it tends to look black. Ergo it's hard to see some 30% of the device's depth.The new design curves the sides more so you get even less visual cues as to its actual thickness.You're not supposed to &quot;see it right&quot;.</text>

It's in very product now from the magic tracked, to the iMac, to the MBA and mbp. That old style mbp aluminum will not be the color and it will be the one that's in the iPad now. I have to see this in person bc judging from a small picture is very hard. I wouldnt mind this if it was ipad 2. But this kind of reminds me of the ip4. We all hated it at first but now it's one of the best looking smart phones out there. Johnny Ive doesn't disappoint</text>

	<text>Wonder if they managed to cut down on the weight w/ these form factor changes.  I'm used to it now but would certainly not mind a 100g lighter ipad; it would also really screw up the competition, which seems to have kept the weight at the same range as the wifi version.</text>

	<text>I'm amazed that some people are already judging this as if this is the real iPad 2.it's only a mockup, which only helps users see how it fits into their cases. They don't need to add anything else to this to make it stunning. it's only a mockup, wait for judgement until we actually see the real thing.In my opinion, i reckon that sometime over CES, or by the end of next week, we'll hear something about an event, just a hunch really.</text>

	<text>The only way for Apple to avoid all these leaks is for them to start their own manufacturing. They ARE too popular now. Chinese workers get paid so little, that you can't blame them for wanting to make a few extra bucks on the side, and at the end of the day, Foxconn isn't Apple.</text>

	<text>Having silly discussions based on a simple mock up (that we dont know is even accurate) are just a waste of time. &quot;I like it&quot; &quot; I hate it&quot; &quot;It looks great&quot; !!Compare this picture of a shoe horn/holder to how your foot looks...look similar? No! The mock up depicts as much as what the new iPad will look like as the I do to a body cast. They may well have put &quot;alleged&quot; speaker grill and tapered sides based on nothing but rumors, to whip up a storm...it worked!Personally,,i feel the iPad 2 would look amazing if it just looked like a 9.7 inch iphone4, not the new iPod touch (it looks kinda cheap). Here's hoping!!!</text>

	<text>That is darn ugly. I'd much rather see it look more like a big iPhone 4 with the aluminum edge. But more likely liquid metal to keep it light, thin and strong.</text>

	<text>In previous threads people have complained that you can't use the current iPad on a flat surface because of the rounded back.Solution:Give the iPad a flat back.In response to this, others complain that you won't be able to easily lift it from said flat surface because there will be no edge to grip.Solution:Give the iPad a flat back AND a tapered edge.Now that this seems like the way Apple has gone, people are complaining that it's a step backwards.I guess this only proves the old axiom that you can't please everyone.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byslicecomNone of my Apple products will EVER be put in a case, so design matters to me.I've never understood why people buy a device with industry leading industrial design, then put it in an ugly case.  I've never damaged any of my iPhones or my iPad or my MacBook's by not using cases.  In many instances, cases cause more damage than they prevent (scratches etc...).Sure, it's much better looking without the case but it is a little slippery. I'd hate to drop it and in the Apple case it's got a great grip that the cat can't push off the coffee table.And I love the case's ability to tilt the screen which makes using it on a plane more enjoyable.And I place the flap over the display on the elliptical or stationary bike at the gym. That iPad aint falling down for anything and I'm watching Netflix at the gym instead of Oprah.You can &quot;never&quot; understand reasons like these? Oh well.</text>

	<text>As for the uglification of sleek iPads with cases, may I suggest theSaddleback Leather iPad Sleeve. Protects it well when not in use, fully exposes the device in all its glory when needed, and ages well by acquiring a stylish &quot;distressed&quot; look when scratched, rubbed, etc. I get lots of complements on mine.I agree most cases just look cheap/cheesy, and hide the device's elegant design. Pick a sleeve that complements, not conceals, your expensive purchase.</text>

	<text>I think the iPad is thin enough. I like the weight it has to it for it's current dimensions. If it gets lighter, then I think it would feel &quot;cheap&quot; or not as substantial. The &quot;heaviness&quot; of the current model reminds me that despite it's thin form factor, it is not a piece of crap.</text>

One needs to look at portable devices with a whole different mindset than one would have comparing desk top devices that may function by brute-force power.I think HOW a device carefully handles data to preserve battery life may be designed to trump raw power in getting better performance while not at the cost of portability. At the end of the day it's not just the device specs, it's the whole eco-system that it is part of.</text>

	<text>I'm hoping that people will agree with here. Don't people think Apple have benchmarked themselves too high for the iPad 1? Especially for it's sleek design and perfect weight distribution in collaboration with it's size consideration. It's set the tone for other companies to follow and how can Apple beat itself without making serious changes?Any design change is going to be like marmite. You'll either you love it or hate it. At this early stage of these case designs, it's a no-no for me. The 1st iPad has it right in every design hardware and software wise in my opinion.Apple could of just upped the hardware inside a revised case (like 3G to 3GS). Knowing Apple though, it's too early to do that that yet. Let's wait for iPad 3 for that.</text>

	<text>Of course not really sure it's real, but not fond of the idea of making the back of the iPad look just like the back of the iPod just so Apple can say it's a &quot;family&quot; of products.  The back of the current iPad feels so good in the hands and is pretty easy to grip for a device of it's size and weight.  The matte/satin aluminum feels very nice as well.  God forbid they make it shinny and slick like the iPod.  If they do that - I'll just skip it and hope they learn their lesson for iPad3.the  Form should definitely follow function in this case!</text>

Sorry, what you want it not coming ever. If you want an Apple touch screen UI, it's iOS.How did you come up with that wish list anyway? What are you trying to do with this device that you can't do with the current iPad or a MacBook? Each is tailored to a different set of needs. If you're mainly just a consumer of content and entertainment, and you enjoy touch screen UIs, go with the iPad. If you need to do more content creation (where the precision of a real keyboard and pointing device with cursor are more efficient than using your chubby digits), go with a MacBook.Often I think these kinds of wish lists have more to do withspec envythan real-world usage needs.</text>

Apple needs to stop trying to make everything thinner. My son wanted a new Ipod Touch with the camera in it, and after using it awhile, he and I both preferred the last generation thicker style. It was easier to hold and definitely easier to hit the sleep button and to plug in connector.The current Ipad's shape is nice. Why ruin it and make it thinner yet?I guess if the new design wasn't different enough, then people wouldn't want to buy a new one.Give it a rest Apple!</text>

No need to be so hostile. It is my opinion and I have modest computing needs and I like the idea of an iPad as a primary computer. I was just imputting my own opinion of what I like and by the way, those specs aren't unbelievable. It has nothing to do with &quot;spec envy&quot;. Those are just what I would need for it to run smoothly. And obviously I am not wanting it to come never like you thought. It is just far from what stage the iPad is in right now.</text>
