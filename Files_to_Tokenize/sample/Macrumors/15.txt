	<text>One of the major questions about future iPhones has been at what point Apple will choose to offer "4G" LTE compatibility.  With Verizon only just beginning to roll out its own 4G network, rumors have indicated that the CDMA-based iPhone 4 widely rumored for a launch early this year will not support 4G.  The bigger question has been whether Apple will support 4G in the fifth-generation iPhone presumably set to debut sometime in the middle of the year, withseveral reportsindicating that Apple will skip 4G compatibility at that point as well.In covering a CES keynote address by AT&T;'s Ralph de la Vega,Boy Genius Reportnotesthat de la Vega's comments suggest that a 4G LTE iPhone is in fact not coming until 2012.De la Vega included Apple in his list of manufacturers set to launch LTE devices in 2012, implying that AT&T; will launch a 4G LTE-compatible Apple iPhone next yearDe la Vega reportedly also confirmed AT&T;'s plans for an accelerated timetable for deployment of its LTE network, looking to launchsometime this yearwith completion set for 2013.  He also noted that the HSPA+ improvements that have already spread to much of the company's network already come relatively close to 4G speeds.While many observers have been hoping that Apple will be an early adopter of LTE technology to support the ever-increasing data demands of iPhone users, past history has suggested that Apple will sit on the sidelines until the LTE service becomes more widespread and has had time to mature.  Despite the fact that AT&T; offered a 3G data network at the time of the iPhone's initial launch in 2007, the first-generation device did not support the technology and operated only on the carrier's slower-but-more-widely-available EDGE network.Update:Boy Genius Reporthas updated its article to note that AT&T; has officially denied that de la Vega confirmed an LTE iPhone for 2012.  It appears that the confusion has stemmed from AT&T;'s decision to call both its existing HSPA+ network and its forthcoming LTE network "4G" for marketing purposes.Well, AT&T;'s ridiculous decision to call both HSPA+ and LTE "4G" is already causing problems -- AT&T; contacted us to let us know that no iPhone-related LTE announcements were made. Apparently the "4G" mentioned alongside de la Vega's mention of Apple did not refer to LTE "4G".</text>

	<text>no point in offering the LTE iPhone before the network is wide spread enough. If they release it too early people will only bash the iPhone for bad service not realizing the the LTE network is not ready for it.</text>

	<text>Apple waits until networks are mature to a stable point. That's why they waited on 3G. Same thing is happening with LTE.So there's your answer on Verizon - LTE iPhone in 2012. If there's a Verizon iPhone this year it will be CDMA only. They aren't supporting two different devices until AT&amp;T gets it into gear.Also gives a hint to what will be in the next iPhone - HSDPA+.</text>

	<text>2012 will be a good year.LTE iphone on ATT and iphone on other networks like Verizon.I finally got an iphone in November figuring 2012 would be a good time for my contract to run out.  Should have done it earlier in the year but no matter.  A few months wait in 2012 will be all right.</text>

	<text>I am eagerly awaiting the launch of a 3G network that does what it is promised in a consistent and reliable fashion! 2012 sounds about right for that. 4G LTE in 2012  that has the chipset, network coverage, and backhaul to create an acceptable experience that lives up to the hype sounds like a pipe dream.Think I sound grumpy/unrealistic? Remember, it was in 2007 when people were looking at Jobs cockeyed for offering an EDGE only device. Today, 3+ yrs later, a vast majority of US iPhone users aren't much better off.Network coverage is poor, 3G areas with coverage don't have good spectrum design, or are quite over-subscribed.It's not about the hardware outside of having a chipset that is efficient and a battery with the mAh to drive it, so the pace of HW development is largely irrelevant to whether 4G will happen in 2012.I wouldn't hold my breath, if it happens, it will be mostly in name only/will only function as promised in large markets with very low population density (e.g. forget major metros - more sprawling suburban areas bordering these markets).</text>

	<text>Not surprised.  3G is not that slow as it is, so there really is no rush.  Summer 2012 seems like a viable release date for a 4G iPhone.  Though I don't know how Apple will hold off the competition.</text>

There's no point for it. What the other manufacturers are doing is unveiling worth less devices at this time of year. Look at Evo. Only a few chosen markets would equip 4G speeds for the phone, and the people went running around, showing off a 4G phone without a 4G location (unless you're in a larger city). &amp; yet drain the battery dramatically. Apple. what they're gonna do is experiment they're phones + data usage/speeds to determine how long they can keep they're battery running. Just like they did with multi-tasking. now that's true engineering!</text>

	<text>The &quot;previous history&quot; that we all base our expectations upon is a single data point: Apple released the first iPhone with edge rather than 3G.  While apple seemed satisfied, it was one of the major complaints against the device (justified or not).Apple did have even the iPhone 3GS be capable of HSPA+ before it was widely available.Finally, what about backwards compatibility?  Unless there is a technical tradeoff (3G has worse battery life as compared to EDGE), why wouldn't apple release an LTE phone to let users benefit where they can and just default back to 3G where it isn't available?  Let the blame rest on AT&amp;T to get their network in line.</text>

	<text>Yeah, obvious there won't be a &quot;4G&quot; iPhone yet, even for the upcoming fake 4G networks. There is no national 4G network of any significance, and we don't even have HSPA+ support yet. Cellular network technology developments and rollouts move much slower than a lot of people seem to understand.The headlining news here is that De la Vega apparently leaked Apple's iPhone plans at a CES keynote? A &quot;4G&quot; iPhone next year was absolutely not a sure thing, and even if it had been, you don't talk Apple's plans before Apple does. Is AT&amp;T maybe feeling less beholden now that Verizon's getting the green light?</text>

	<text>This makes a certain amount of Apple sense to me. The strategy Apple seems to take more often then not, is to rely on other peoples unproven technology. They will be an &quot;Early Adopter&quot;, if the technology has been proven. Additionally, any problems with a Network Provider's LTE service would reflect on the iPhone, even if undeserved. I'm sure Apple is well aware of that.Basically, if Apple takes on an unproven network service, they will make nerds happy, and run the risk of making the general consumer population unhappy. If they don't run with the technology out of the gate, nerds that don't understand Apple will be unhappy, but the general consumer population will be happy.Guess which audience gives Apple more money, and has more sum total influence</text>

I won't go so far as to say &quot;640K ought to be enough for everybody&quot; or anything, but please do explain to me why you need your cell phone to be 5x faster than my home broadband that gives me three-tuner HD PVR capability in addition to all them lovely Interwebs.I know this is CES season and big shiny numbers are all the rage, but seriously.

	<text>Summer of 2012 is too late.  With major cities allready being covered now, it doesn't make sense to wait another full release cycle.I think Apple is going to revise the June launch cycle.  We have all heard about the Verizon getting iPhone this spring.  But what sense would it make to bring a 9month old iphone 4 to VZ.  They will release the iPhone5 ahead of schedule, breaking the pattern set in previous years.  This will make releases more like 9-10 months instead of 12.  So the 2012 release, when they finally go full 4G (LTE or WiMax), will be early in the first quarter.  Apple needs to do this with all the increased pressure in the smartphone market.As for the iPhone5, HSPA+ is a possibility.  I don't think the form factor or other options will change much, other than a software upgrade.  Verizon users will be happy, but so will AT&amp;T users with big speed increases.  And look for T-Mobile to get in on the fun.  If AT&amp;T exclusiveness is over, why wouldn't all carriers get on board?  I don't see Verizon paying a big premium to be 'second exclusive' carrier.  T-Mobile and Sprint are minor players, but will help make iPhone5 a huge seller.</text>

Basically they start LTE in the rural areas so they don't have to bring fibre cable there. It's a way cheaper method to deliver broadband internet speeds to rural areas.So ironically the weakest network spots are the ones to first get the LTE treatment. But OTOH it's making the telcos money as they earn in selling broadband internet access.More background hereSo, yeah, my next phone has to be LTE-capable (because LTE will be here within 2 years before contract expiry)</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byEarendilThis makes a certain amount of Apple sense to me. The strategy Apple seems to take more often then not, is to rely on other peoples unproven technology. They will be an &quot;Early Adopter&quot;, if the technology has been proven. Additionally, any problems with a Network Provider's LTE service would reflect on the iPhone, even if undeserved. I'm sure Apple is well aware of that.Basically, if Apple takes on an unproven network service, they will make nerds happy, and run the risk of making the general consumer population unhappy. If they don't run with the technology out of the gate, nerds that don't understand Apple will be unhappy, but the general consumer population will be happy.Guess which audience gives Apple more money, and has more sum total influenceThat's a good point, and you may be right.But, the potential issue is that if the nerds (I'll use your term for now), make enough noise, it can color the general public opinion.  For example, the whole antennagate issue made a big stir over an issue that most of the general public never would have noticed.  I met many people who knew &quot;something was wrong&quot; with the iPhone 4 but didn't really understand what it was or whether it would really affect them. However, I may be proving you right here, as despite the significant publicity the antenna issue got, the iPhone 4 still sold really well.</text>

The problem is the coverage sucks, and even inside of coverage zones I found myself falling back to EDGE quiet often even though the map says I should have 3G. Verizon might not be as fast as AT&amp;T peaks but it's consistent and I never fall back to 1X (CDMA's equivalent to EDGE).</text>

	<text>They're not &quot;taking&quot; anyone's cash, people are willingly giving them their cash. You seem really bitter around the whole concept of &quot;paying for nice things&quot;, what's up with that?Apple makes nice things, they tend to make and release nice things on a predictable yearly basis, what about this is so evil?People LINE UP to give Apple their cash, anticipate, and make whole websites about the nice things Apple makes. If all this is just highway robbery to you and isn't a valuable/desireable upgrade, why are you party to it?Apple *IS* a for-profit business, I'll remind you, taking in cash is a huge part of what they do. But, I don't think anyone can reasonably argue that the pace of innovation is stagnant or just superficial. Go throw rocks at other businesses who put out point releases purely for the &quot;upgrade&quot; - but you'll lose that argument with Apple for the vast majority of products. Besides, legacy support on Apple hardware is very good. They're not a &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; business model.Quote:Originally Posted byPrecision4Isnt this obvious??They will not release an LTE version because they want more of your money. VZN users have been waiting a long time for the iphone. All will jump on for the first CDMA version, 6 months later, they will all upgrade to an LTE version.

	<text>ATT *hopes* we think HSPA+, etc will fix the problem. It won't. The problem isn't a carrier signal. It's spectrum, backhaul, and plain oversubscription.ATT sold massive amounts of unlimited data plans, data handsets, and didn't have the spectrum from the handset to the tower to do it, regardless of what 3G technology or 3G+ technology they try to schelp.Then, they simply didn't do the investment (or couldn't get approval) for the right physical presence sites to operate the various spectrum they bought at auction/from the Cingular acquisition. They had their old TDMA stations they migrated to GSM and later to 3G, but the physical design of a voice-centric TDMA network (e.g. the spacing/needs/density of physical sites) is MARKEDLY different from a GSM network, let alone a network evolving into being very data (packet) centric.Then, from what under-built physical network they did deploy, they didn't build in a very good backhaul infrastructure.ATT isn't stupid, neither is it poor. But, they do have some massive leadership issues, some difficult legacy/technology/real estate/heritage/acquisition issues, etc that are all exacerbated more on the focus more on marketing &amp; sounding good than walking the walk.This HSPA+ thing is a great example. de Vega and team are putting Fancy Feast on a plate and calling it fine Foie Gras. They want to win this &quot;4G&quot; war in words &amp; labels when they really should be focused on winning the &quot;customer experience&quot; war. They're *lying* (and they know it, how can de Vega go up there and call HSPA+ 4G? He's got no ethics). HSPA+ is NOT 4G. It's sexed up 3G.It's not a question of whether they can do it, the technology exists, or even if the capital exists - it's a question of willingness, culture, and priorities. ATT shows what theirs are everyday, and it's not the build out of a network with the best customer service. That company is called Verizon(they have their own bevy of issues, but being focused on network build-out and coverage is NOT one of them!).Quote:Originally Posted byalent1234duh, because HSPA+ and other newer technologies will fix the problems that people are experiencing now due to demand</text>

Do you really think ATT's HSPA+ network is just sitting there ready to go?It isn't. ATT doesn't cover 250M people, they cover *perhaps* half that, and they don't cover them with solid, reliable service, either, that takes the pool down to perhaps 75M - on a good day with you head pointed in just the right direction/angle.Do you know how ATT came up with that 250M number? Some ATT marketing wonk looked at a map of where they have cell sites, put a 5 mile radius around each one, colored it in in photoshop/some GIS package, added up the cities' populations and came up with that 250M number.Have you ever used a cellular network? ATT specifically? If so, then surely you know that just because you have a site somewhere within a 5 mile radius of yourself whether it is usable to actually place a call or transfer data is a completely different story.That ATT map, their claims, and your assumptions about ATT have more holes in them than Windows 7.Quote:Originally Posted bykre62WOWWrong, the phones are only HSPA compatible, not +.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bykre62WRONG, BOTH OF YOUTHe ITU recently revised their definition of 4G to included enhanced 3G technologies that offer significant speed improvements. HSPA+ is now 4G!Bottom line:  it is what it is unless we revise it to be what we say it is, even if it is not.Fan me later.</text>

But there are places such as my house where I only get 2/4 bar on Edge and nearly no 3G. I know my house has something to do with it but that isn't what I'm getting at.LTE wont arrive in the UK until 2013 at the earliest. Behind everyone else</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bybmustafATT *hopes* we think HSPA+, etc will fix the problem. It won't. The problem isn't a carrier signal. It's spectrum, backhaul, and plain oversubscription.ATT sold massive amounts of unlimited data plans, data handsets, and didn't have the spectrum from the handset to the tower to do it, regardless of what 3G technology or 3G+ technology they try to schelp.Then, they simply didn't do the investment (or couldn't get approval) for the right physical presence sites to operate the various spectrum they bought at auction/from the Cingular acquisition. They had their old TDMA stations they migrated to GSM and later to 3G, but the physical design of a voice-centric TDMA network (e.g. the spacing/needs/density of physical sites) is MARKEDLY different from a GSM network, let alone a network evolving into being very data (packet) centric.Then, from what under-built physical network they did deploy, they didn't build in a very good backhaul infrastructure.ATT isn't stupid, neither is it poor. But, they do have some massive leadership issues, some difficult legacy/technology/real estate/heritage/acquisition issues, etc that are all exacerbated more on the focus more on marketing &amp; sounding good than walking the walk.This HSPA+ thing is a great example. de Vega and team are putting Fancy Feast on a plate and calling it fine Foie Gras. They want to win this &quot;4G&quot; war in words &amp; labels when they really should be focused on winning the &quot;customer experience&quot; war. They're *lying* (and they know it, how can de Vega go up there and call HSPA+ 4G? He's got no ethics). HSPA+ is NOT 4G. It's sexed up 3G.It's not a question of whether they can do it, the technology exists, or even if the capital exists - it's a question of willingness, culture, and priorities. ATT shows what theirs are everyday, and it's not the build out of a network with the best customer service. That company is called Verizon(they have their own bevy of issues, but being focused on network build-out and coverage is NOT one of them!).I definately agree with the backhaul comment.  The one thing that really stood out for me watching the ATT announcement was his comment &quot;AT&amp;T plans to have the nationwide LTE rollout complete by the end of 2013 and says that two-thirds of its mobile traffic will have access to fiber or Ethernet backhaul by the end of this year.&quot; I'm not even going to ask what he means by complete ... matching the current 3G footprint?  Matching the 3G and edge combined?  What I noticed was by the end of the year, 2/3 of the backhaul will be Ethernet or fiber.  What have they been doing? And what has (is) it running on now?  It's great to put up towers to allow more users, but I'm a backhaul first, or at least the same time kinda person.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byNoExpectationsWow...I guess the ITU has no backbone anymore.  Thanks.I don't think it's a lack of backbone, I think they flat out blew it.  Didn't I read that they said what 4G is ... last month?  I firmly believe they should have told us last month what 5G is.  Everyone has been talking 4G for years.  They should have said what defines it years ago, especially if it's only a speed rating.</text>

I thought their backhaul was farther along than that.  I'd like to see where verizon stands right now.  I did catch where verizon said they are connecting LTE's backhaul with fiber only.  At least they are not just slapping it up.  Hope it continues.</text>
