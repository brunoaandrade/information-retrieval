	<text>An enticing headline over the weekendat PocketNowclaims that Verizon is buying up iPhone-related domains, presumably as a prelude to the launch of an actual Verizon iPhone.The report notes that bothiPhoneOnVerizon.comandiPhoneForVerizon.comare under the control of Verizon Trademark Services LLC.  The same company controls Verizon's main domain atVerizon.com.Screenshot of historical Who-Is data from 2008The domains do appear to have been transferred over to Verizon -- but it all happenedin late 2008.  Verizon presumably had a legitimate trademark claim to the use of "Verizon" in a domain name regardless of their intention of even launching an iPhone.  Strangely the pages still point to the link farms that were hosted there originally by the owners.While we do think that Verizon will be coming out with an iPhone in the near future, this doesn't really offer any more evidence.</text>

	<text>Yeah, I will STILL be surprised when this is announced. I am on Verizon and would have most definitely purchased an iPhone if it came sooner. But I jumped on the Android wagon and am very happy. I can't even use my iPod touch anymore, I just prefer Android OS. However, the iPhone is still an excellent device...please don't flame</text>

I have the iPhone 4 and MyTouch 4G and the Andriod phone, while more reliable for calling in many areas where AT&amp;T is weak, the user experience on the iPhone is still better to me.  I do not like the browser in the MyTouch.I do like the fact I can download files directly to the SD card on the MyTouch and browse those files.  If Apple/AT&amp;T would give us a bit more  file access and simple, free WiFi sharing I would rarely use this myTouch.Cheers,</text>

You can download software for it from 3rd party websites. Plus, much of what you said is personal preference. iOS is still a very smooth and very functional OS, packed with features. I wouldn't like many of Android's features, because I'm used to the iOS look and feel. You got used to the Android's look and feel, and most likely wouldn't enjoy the iOS look and feel. It's that simple: Personal preference.EDIT: Also, as steve correctly pointed out, megapixels isn't all that matters. The iPhone's 5 megapixel camera often takes better pictures than android phones with higher megapixels. I'm not saying it's this way on all Android phones, but at least some aren't as good at focusing on things closeup as the iPhone is, which in some situations can make a huge difference, and then there's the backside illuminated sensor.</text>

	<text>Exactly, most is personal preference, but people say iphone is packed with features but never list them, what feature is it packed with that you can't do on android phones? And of course it's smooth, they had years to perfect it like that, the droid may lag sometimes but its still fairly new, my original iPhone was no where near as smooth as the current one, and the new iOS sucks on my wifes 3GS and is horrible on my 3G I leave laying around to play with as an iPod. And as far as the new one, if they would have fixed the antenna issue without only giving out free cases, maybe I wouldn't have returned it and looked into droid, giving me a bumper is not a fix for the phone, you might as well have sent me a piece of tape</text>

	<text>Tethering is not free on verizon either so it's not a carrier issue, because apple is so locked down, they don't allow the free tethering app, the droid allows you to download a tethering app that allows you to tether for free even though verizon wants to charge you for it. So what's not fair is how steve jobs wants to tell you how you should use your phone, if you jailbreak the iPhone you can tether for free so again it has nothing to do with the difference in carriers, it's a phone thing.</text>

Some people don't give a rat about quality because they want to overclock their android. It's all personal preferences.YOU DON'T HAVE TO BASH OTHERS TO MAKE YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE BETTER BECAUSE YOU USE ANDROID OR IOS.</text>

Sorry, but neither platform is going to provide that for you by default.Android may make it easier, but the iPhone provides the frameworks just like Android does.  But if you have to violate your contract, its not a very good argument.Free tethering is not an advertised feature of either platform.</text>

	<text>No problem, glad the info was helpful. The 7 screen thing is on the htc phones along with droid os called htc sense ui, if you YouTube it you can see some vids on how it works@lincolntran,All in all, i agree with lincolntran, just dont like someone calling me stupid when i am listing things i like about my current phone, especially when i am very far from stupid. Believe it or not I like both os', on one hand I love what droid offers over the iPhone but I also love how smooth and user friendly the iPhone is, and of course how nice the hardware is, I just wish sometimes apple would open up a little on the app store and let some stuff through that would not harm the phone in any way. When the iPhone comes to verizon, may have to look into it again and see if they fixed any outstanding issues it has. I had to dump it by me because AT&amp;T is pretty bad, was dropping calls everyday@pdjuddI know it is, but who follows every rule on their contract, hell even jail breaking breaks apples rules but I know plenty of people who do it for the free tethering. I'll take the chance breaking a rule that I won't get caught on to save $15-$20 a month when I am already paying ridiculous prices for a data plan. They're screwing us on the pricing so it serves them right to get screwed by some of their customers in return</text>

Another 4 of those are only Sense UI Phones (HTCs own User Interface) and 1 of them is an app but I will give you the tethering. Now lets think only a portion of phones are htc so that blow a lot of those &quot;points&quot; away also a lot of phones non-htc only have 5 mp cameras (although the iPhone is said to have the best camera on a mobile phone. Period.) and there are some that can't tether (motorola droid, for example which a lot of people still have) the speaker quality and GPS are opinions, not facts. And when the iPhone was First anounced Steve jobs stated that the wether and stocks apps were &quot;wigets&quot;.  Lastly like you said user replaceable batteries aren't something everyone wants. Now what does this prove 1. android IS fragmented 2. You are making opinionated and pointless comments on a website dedicated to the mac and the iOS devices, which, I believe will just cause more comments (like the one im posting now) to arise and cause a fight. Go post on android forums instead.</text>

The wife and daughter use the Droids and the wife hate the phone but like my iPhone.. The only reason she has the Droid because she on Verizon and she will not leave them.. Oh also Androids does not sync or back up(I mean Music, Photos, Apps and etc.) up to macs out of the box without some type of 3rd party software.. iOS sync up fine on both Mac and PC...Quote:Originally Posted byblahblah100I also like how you say the iPhone camera is the best on a mobile phone, but then attack him for his point about the speakers and GPS.  Do you smell that?  I do.Well seeing that it been proven (with facts) that the iPhone camera is the best on a mobile phone. There is no proof of facts that Android phone has better speaker and GPS... That part is based on his opinion not facts.. So I think you need to re-track your lame comment &quot;Do you smell that?&quot;....</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byBriChiTethering is not free on verizon either so it's not a carrier issue, because apple is so locked down, they don't allow the free tethering app, the droid allows you to download a tethering app that allows you to tether for free even though verizon wants to charge you for it. So what's not fair is how steve jobs wants to tell you how you should use your phone, if you jailbreak the iPhone you can tether for free so again it has nothing to do with the difference in carriers, it's a phone thing.You are incorrect. Its not a phone thing its a carrier thing. ATT does not allow tethering on the iPhone but if I hop a plane to Europe I can suddenly magically tether. That makes it a carrier issue, not a phone issue.Not to mention reading through your posts its obvious you do not know as much as you think you do about the Android platform...</text>

That makes it a carrier issue, not a phone issue.yes you can, you are incorrect, On my wifes iPhone, it now has the tethering option and on ATT site it shows...Please note:  A data plan is required for the life of your iPhone service and cannot be removed in the future.DataPro 2GB for iPhonewith Tethering(requires iOS 4)   $45.00/monthiOS 4 required for iPhone Tethering. i0S 4 will work with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G.listen guys, I am not here to fight, I stated so called &quot;opinions&quot; on a forum I visit daily, People bash iPhone and people bash Droid, Same as mac vs pc, its all opinions in the end from reading both sides, Does not justify anyone calling people names on the forum and that is why I even responded, Honestly in the end, I can care less what people use and do not use on their phones, I tether for free which is a big thing for ME, I can care less that I am violating a contract and I knew this when I signed it, It's one of many reasons I bought a droid phone, I didnt want to pay for tethering and I did not want to jailbreak a phone in order to do it either, period. I read it is easy to download and install free tethering, so I got itas far as widgets, the stock app and weather app IMO are not widgets, shouldnt widgets be on the a screen fully viewable and updated at all times like the way i have my caledar wiget always viewable on my screen and friendstream widget, same way it is on Sense UI and Windows machines? If I have to open the stock/weather &quot;widget&quot; and wait for it to update info, then its just another app, not a widget</text>

	<text>the gps on the iphone is a joke, I had it and it sucked, the gps on droid uses actual google maps, different street views, talking turn by turn direction... etc... how can anyone possibly think the iphones gps is better, its a joke, If i had to draw a ****ing figure eight one more time with the phone for the gps to work i was gonna throw the phone. just the mere fact that the droid does clear turn by turn voice directions and immediately remaps your route if you go off course proves that it is a better gps system. Just watch some videos on the difference between the 2 and you will agree too</text>

However, the iPhone is still an excellent device...please don't flameI got your point, Thanks For The Information Very Helpful ...</text>

But when your referring to GPS it sounds like your talking about the hardware in the phoneno, sorry for the confusion, I am, like you said, talking about the software &quot;Maps&quot; on Droid and &quot;Maps&quot; on iPhone which are both used when GPS'ing to a location, clearly if you own both or watch videos, the Droids blows Apples away, I havent had one Apple fan tell me that their map/gps app is better then mine, this is why Apple is most likely hiring &quot;map/gps&quot; guys (was a Macrumor I believe weeks ago)</text>
