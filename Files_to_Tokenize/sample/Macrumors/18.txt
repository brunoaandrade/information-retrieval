	<text>So I go to upload a Keynote presentation to check out the new features, and I get an error saying prerelease software is not compatible with iwork.com. Never had any problems w iwork.com before.  Anyone else finding this?  Curious what could be causing it.Edit: Nevermind.  Redownloaded from Apple Support Page, working fine now.  Well, fine is a relative term.  Turned a 24MB Keynote into a 66MB Keynote before uploaing (which took a good 10 mins).  But it's a neat feature nonetheless.  Hopefully the Keynote Remote update will actually work.</text>

	<text>At this point especially with this latest software update, it doesn't seem likely they will launch an iWork '11 tomorrow.  It's still a possibility, but I don't think it's going to happen anymore.  Plus, I think Apple would have wanted to show it off and present the new features for the software like they have in the past.  Oh well, time will tell when the App Store launches tomorrow.  I think launching the App Store is the largest focus on Apple right now, not releasing an iWork '11 update.</text>

I tell them, &quot;I'll give you a hint&quot;, Windows 7 has nothing to do with it, that's why they look professional.Same deal with Keynote and slideshows.Even though Numbers (and iWork in general) gets better graphing capabilities with each release, it's still not good enough.Granted, I'm a senior in high school and &quot;Good Enough&quot; for me has been a mcving target. It seems that with each release I've thought &quot;if only I had this last year... But it's not good enough for this year.&quot; (and then I use it anyways and have to find some way to screw around with transparency or add extra shapes on the graph to pretend Numbers was actually able to do what I wanted.)Oh, and it kind of sucks that I had to install a plug-in to get an equation editor... it's not the prettiest thing, and it's behavior is often unmaclike, but it gets the job done at least...</text>

	<text>Well I'm not sure if this is a feature of the new update, or just a fix of a wrong iWork installation, but my apps open up in a snap of a finger now, whereas before it would take a few &quot;jumps&quot; of the icon for the app to start up. Or this might be just a temporary behaviour :-/. We'll see.Mind, it shouldn't have been slow on my 27&quot; i7 iMac... Should it? But it had been.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byblacktape242agreed!also, i know im beating a dead horse buttttt.......  iweb update?????????I think there was a very good reason why there was no iWeb update when the new iLife came out. I think Apple stopped development on that version and have created a new, built from the ground up HTML5 standards version of iWeb. But either through internal timescales or the gerneral lack of browser support for some of the new HTML5 standards, Apple decided to pull it from the iLife lineup until HTML5 becomes more mature and IE catches up.This would explain why there wasn't even a piecemeal update. Apple have been banging on about HTML5 being the future and we should ditch Flash, iWeb creates nasty code and CSS control is poor, not a glowing advert of their beliefs, and it was never going to be fixed. So I predict a new amazing application with the iWeb name next year, and no update to the current version of iWeb until then.</text>

Being able to save and access my files anywhere seamlessly is very important to me.  But to all his or her own, I suppose.Imagine Office sales plummeting and MSFT stock likewise!  I can dream can't I?Next up,  moving all my photos to Flickr or Picasa.  Flickr is limited in scope.  I have to check Picasa out.  I think iPhoto is also going the way of the dodo bird.</text>

	<text>Am I correct in thinking iWork.com is only for archiving and sharing your documents while with Google Docs you can create and work on your documents online (with the ability to copy to your computer and work offline if you so desire)? If so, they're like chalk and cheese. iWork would serve no purpose for me while Google Docs would serve all.</text>

If iWord '09 does what you need to do, why do you care about people that might have newer stuff? Just use your own.Other than that, if the package isn't opened already, you might be able to bring it back to the store once '11 is in the stores. Not sure, depends on the store...</text>

If it happened to you, it didn't last long.You're joking, right? Have you heard of aeroplanes, trains, boats, buses, many hotels, power outages, ISP problems? The list goes on...For any serious work, cloud productivity software is fundamentally flawed. No internet = no work. Go to the pub.So what is the cloud good for? One word: Dropbox.</text>

YOU were the one who said you work in the cloud, so YOU rely on being connected... YOU were talking about productivity apps in the cloud, and suggested everyone was almost always connected. I simply pointed out situations where connection is unavailable.Better still... Now you say that being dependent upon being connected is a truly hellish experience. Thank you.

I love it far more than Office.I use pages a lot to write all my university papers. The only thing I would add, is support for equations, or some kind of equations editor other than MathType. Until now I've been using Latexit, which is great, but some kind of integrated solution would be even better.</text>

Now you say that being dependent upon being connected is a truly hellish experience. Thank you. You have just defeated your own argument that cloud software is the only way to go. Truly magnificent!I think the best solution to work in the cloud is using dropbox:- You have everything local using your local apps- Everything is automatically synced to all of your machines- Automatic backup of everythingIt no longer matters to me which of my machines I'm using - I always have the latest version of all my documents. If I am some place where I have no internet, I can still work with my files and once I'm connected again, it automatically syncs back to the cloud and all my other machines. This way I have the best of both worlds. If I am on a machine that does not has dropbox (e.g. at a friends house) I can still access everything through the web interface. The only thing I wish they would have is a 'network drive' with my stuff similar to iDisk (but faster and functioning). My whole digital life is in the meantime on dropbox - and it is fast (I can modify a file on my Laptop and by the time I walked to my desktop the update is already there). I can even use it cross platform.</text>
