	<text>Reutershas beenkeeping on topof theiOS alarm clock bugthat has seen users experiencing problems with alarms activating properly in the new year.  Despite reassurances from Apple over the weekend that alarms would begin functioning properly today, a number of users have reportedly continued to experience problems today, the first day of work in 2011 for many people.Some iPhone users across the globe complained of malfunctioning alarms on the first working day of 2011, even after Apple reassured users that its phones' built-in clocks will work from Monday.Bloggers, as well as Facebook and Twitter users, complained they missed flights or were late to arrive at work as the alarm built into Apple's iPhone failed to go off for a third straight day for some users.Apple has yet to offer an updated response to the issue today, and it is unclear why only some users are continuing to experience the bug, which affects non-recurring alarms.The New Year's bug is not the first alarm-related issue to affect Apple's iOS devices.  Last year, an issue related toDaylight Savings Time calculationsaffected recurring alarms beginning in Australia and New Zealand in late September and moving around the world as other countries either began or ended Daylight Savings Time.  Apple addressed that specific bug with the release of iOS 4.2 in late November.</text>

	<text>If folks only rely on a PHONE for their PRIMARY alarm, and then miss flights/work/etc., that's on them. People should know that an electronic device that does more than be an alarm clock might mess up that feature. Why people don't just spring for a $10 travel clock that works perfectly 100% of the time (save for battery death/changing) is beyond me.</text>

I mean a bug like this once is pretty lame, but forgivable. But twice? Come on, no excuses there. I could buy a $4 crappy clock from Wal-Mart that would at least work. My $200 &quot;smart&quot;phone can't even play a sound file at a certain time?Quote:Originally Posted byBigTRQIf folks only rely on a PHONE for their PRIMARY alarm, and then miss flights/work/etc., that's on them.

Why people don't just spring for a $10 travel clock that works perfectly 100% of the time (save for battery death/changing) is beyond me.Because a $200 smartphone should be able, without a doubt, to work as an alarm clock. You let a $200 phone off the hook but tell us to rely on a $10 piece of crap clock? Come on dude, stop drinking the kool aid. I love Apple as much as the next guy but they still deserve criticism.</text>

The iPhone works fine as an alarm clock, and you get to wake up to your premade ringtones instead of the annoying beeping of a cheap alarm clock. As much as I love Apple they goofed up this time, but they can't be perfect all the time.. :PI must admit that I'm gonna have a hard time trusting apple's clock app for the next few days so I'll have to remove the dust off of my old alarm clock and set it has a backup. Or use another app.. But I don't know if that's gonna fix the problem.</text>

	<text>I actually stopped wearing a watch after having the 3G iPhone...However, as much as I've used the alarm for various things at home and on the road, I have actually never used my iPhone as an alarm clock to wake up in the morning...I have an alarm clock on the night stand, and there is usualy one in the hotel where I stay while on the road.I agree, Apple must get their act together on this one...Also, are you people kidding me?  Did I read here that someone missed a flight because the alarm didn't go off ?  I tested my phone when I read about this and it seemed to work fine...Why would some alarms work and some not?  Is everyone running iOS 4.2?And if they are, I wonder how many and which Apps, the people who's alarm didn't go off, have.It could be the OS, and then again, it could be something else.  Curious....</text>

Yes, it's pretty poor that the alarm isn't doing it's basic function, but really - if you are the kind of person that relies on an alarm for a flight or whatever, then surely you would be a little cautious after numerous problems!</text>

	<text>It may be understandable that a crazy bug caused alarms to stop working for some reason, but for them to then scrutinize the code and issue a statement saying that alarms would work today and they didn't isreallyembarrassing!And I agree with that other guy that not sending a text to warn everyone is unforgivable. It really changes my opinion of them. It's such an obvious thing to do for your customers that the only reason they didn't must have been to save money.</text>

	<text>To all those saying &quot;who uses their phone as their main time-piece/alarm clock?&quot;:Here in the UK, walk into ANY school, and into any classroom filled with kids under the age of 16. I guarantee you not ONE pupil in that class will have a watch, or any timepiece on them, other than their phone. Not one. I know it may seem unbelievable - I can hardly believe it and I spend my day teaching them - but it's true.As a 42-year old, Idohave a watch,andan alarm clock, but the generation behind me don't. Like it or not, people use their phone more and more as the thing that does everything for them. This is one problem Apple need to get a grip on.</text>

	<text>My alarm has not gone off so far - I will try creating new alarms.I agree this is inexcusable - while it's not my only alarm, I know a lot of people who use their iPhone as their sole alarm clock, and the stakes for not getting up on time are high.The other bug - that still hasn't been fixed - is that push notifications block the alarm from going off. If I get a text message during the night, my alarm won't go off. Same for push notifications from apps like Twitter for iPhone. When I dismiss the push notification, the alarm goes off.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byDCJ001How many &quot;bugs&quot; are there needing repair?Smug response. Here are a valid few.When you open a contact in Contacts, pressing text message doesn't always immediately add the contact to the Messages app. Very sporadic.When you go out of coverage area, the phone will often show NO SERVICE and can't find the network anymore. Sometimes the only fix is to power cycle. No reported solution so far here, LOTS of users reporting this on various forums.When you create and delete an event in Calendar, you still can see remnants of the blank task after you delete it many times.Bluetooth is very, very picky, not to mention it doesn't support over twenty &quot;standard&quot; Bluetooth services.

	<text>Apple has introduced a new case that has a built in eye to detect the date you set your alarm on.  It will autocorrect the problem for you.Jobs said the alarms are not a problem, but the new case will be free anyway.</text>

	<text>Hilarious!Quote:Originally Posted bybaryonHow the clock app is coded (in pseudocode because I can't really code):If (alarmTime == currentTime and currentYear != 2011){activateAlarm()}After some more digging around in the source code, this is what I found:If (girlfriendBirthday == currentDay and random(10)&gt;8){activateReminder()}...and some more:If (importantMeetingDay == currentDay){deleteAllAlarms()currentDay = TomorrowsetNewHour = random(12)setNewMinutes = random(60)trace(&quot;haha you suck!&quot;)}Fortunately, I wasn't affected by this and was aware of the problem, but I expect that the vast majority of iPhone users don't hang out on tech sites, particularly over a holiday weekend.  It's shameful that Apple continues to have problems with what should be the most basic application on the phone and one that dumbphones have been getting right for decades.  It's inexcusable they didn't send an email or text message to users, many of whom discovered this bug this morning on their first day back to work and school of the year.</text>

	<text>Besides all comments about 'you shouldn't use an iPhone as an alarm clock), this is still a serious bug. An iPhone is offering an alarm service in the iOS, so it should work. Like like mail is Mailing and Messages for texting.But this is getting worse in combination with the clock as timekeeper in general! This clockgets off one second a day(iPhone 4, 4.2.1). You can check that with a free app called 'Time' by Emerald. This should be fixed as well, with or without the use of the setting 'Set time Automatically'.So there is some work to do for Clock in general an the Clock App. And yes, it would be nice to see how much time is left before an alarm goes off...</text>

	<text>I think it's humorous people think it's OUTRAGEOUS to use a smartphone as an alarm clock.  I charge my phone every night (which you should be doing too).  If the power happens to go out, I am covered.  I wake up without hassle.What about the alarm clock I used before I got my smartphone?  That fails without power.  I have missed mid-terms because of it.If you're going to mock people for anything, it's them using a &quot;single&quot; alarm to wake them.  To prevent catastrophe, have multiple devices to wake you up.  Problem solved.  Technology isn't perfect, we know this, if it's important to you, have a backup.</text>

Bugs happen no matter how simple something may seem, one bad assumption can screw many things up.I assume you agree with the first option since if you knew anything about software engineering you'd know that bugs - no matter how simple or complex - happen in software.

So please don't insult my aptitude.It *is* utterly unforgivable. This is an introduced bug in iOS4. If the phone can render the time and date without problem - which it can - then there is absolutely no excuse for the alarm to fail. All it has to do is check that.It's totally basic.It's not even as if this is the first time the alarm system has been shown to be buggy in iOS4. After the daylight savings problems - across the world, with multiple opportunities on multiple dates to issue a fix I might add - we've also had Apple's announcement of a couple of days ago that it was no longer an issue as of 3rd January.Bugs happen, fine - of course they do. Bugs like this should get fixed much quicker by a 300 billion dollar company relying on this OS to drive future growth.

	<text>Alarm for 6:30 worked, Alarm for 7:00 also did.But the 7:30 did not go off.I presume this to be related when the alarms where set. I think I added the 7:30 a long long time before and the 6:30, 7:00 just more recently.Actually I seldom add new alarms, but rather change existing ones (i.e. change one from 7:00 -&gt; 8:00) or something like this. I expect this to work as the function to do it is there.I would also expect this is not an issue (until another BUG date) when you set alarm now, but like i wrote the bug might be related to a strange interference with:+ how 'old' the alarm is (how long before it was created)+ how often it was changed/updated+ is the day 'special' today (DST change, New Year, Steve's Birthday)I have a factory unlocked (from Hongkong) iPhone 4, 32 GB, 4.2.1, non Jailbreaked.So Apple time to role-out 4.2.2 with the Clock App thoroughly tested!I will keep an eye on my 7:30 Alarm and not touch it.</text>

	<text>I think we're seeing a generational gap here between those who can't fathom using their phones as alarms and those who only use their phone as an alarm. Me personally, I use my iPhone as an alarm every day. Being connected to a time server, I never have to worry about it being wrong. (Until now)</text>

	<text>Apple should get out of the app business.  They're too big to address users' needs quickly, they're too big to really care.  If this app had a lone developer working on it in his spare time he would have fixed it on his lunch break.  As it stands, Apple will need to roll it into an iOS update because they don't update their core apps like everyone else.  Everyone will have to update whether they use Apple Clock or not.  Total waste of time and effort on everybody's part.  I should be able to delete it, and forget about it.</text>

Once beginning winter time, once again on January 1st and 2nd, and finally the third time when Apple said all was well on January 3rd.Alarm clocks almost never failed on me. Be it on phones, on watches, or the good old specialized ones. If they did, it was nearly always my fault. Almost never the manufacturers.Alarm clocks just work!Apple products just work!Alarm clocks on Apple products?Apple's definitely got the money, and the IQ, if only there'd be the will, to fix this bug, and communicate accordingly, for I assume it's not supposed to be a feature.One more thing:Clock shuffle. Wake up different, day by day.</text>

	<text>This is no small issue.  While a non-/mal-functioning alarm on a cellphone may not seem like a big deal, it clearly is for those who rely on it.  It may be a simple, common function for cellphones to have, but it does not make it any more acceptable when it fails to work properly or at all.What may be the most annoying fallout from this, the second of the iPhone's alarm issues, is that people are not going to be able to trust the alarm anymore.  If the issue was the alarm wasn't going off at all, all the time, under obvious and reproducible circumstances, they could issue a fix and it would be clear whether the bug had been corrected or not.  However, since no one seems to be able to put a finger on who exactly this affects, why this happens and under what circumstances, when Apple issues a fix, there will always be that lingering sense of doubt in people's heads.  There are some people for whom being late to work, for example, is a hugehugedeal that justcannothappen.  For these people (like my wife, who I just &quot;gifted&quot; my old 3G to yesterday and had the alarm fail this morning, allthreeof them), using the iPhone alarm is no longer a reasonable option.To those of you who don't use the alarm function and don't think this is a big deal, that's because it's not... foryou.  As long as you understand that, there's nothing wrong with feeling that way.</text>

	<text>Glad I have two alarm clocks. My iPhone is my primary one, and goes off first.Then on the other side of my room is my &quot;backup&quot; alarm clock (just a radio alarm), which goes off 15 minutes after my iPhone one (I usually snooze 15 mins). That way, if I accidentally disable my iPhone snooze - which happens quite frequently; not most competent when I first wake up - then my backup alarm will get me.If I have flights to catch, then I would never rely on just one alarm. A radio alarm can still fail if there's a power cut (and it doesn't have a battery) etc.I'm not defending Apple - it is ridiculous that they can't get a clock to work properly, especially with the daylight saving issues earlier this year. But people who miss flights because they solely relied on one alarm are just idiots.Reminds me of Jim Furyk (golfer) who's phone battery died during the night so his alarm never went off, and he missed his tee off time and ended up getting disqualified from the tournament. What a numpty.</text>

AFAIK the countdown timer isn't affected by this?I ALWAYS use the iPhone alarm clock AND ALWAYS also call for a wake-up call a half hour after I *should be awake*. Except on vacation I always have a backup. I mean, if it's that important to be there, wouldn't you want to get a call during coffee that you should be awake?The problem happened once, on vacation (Thank Ford) when my iPhone died during the night because of EDGE service and a very low battery AND the wake-up call not being placed properly. (They called at 6PM, not AM) I laughed my ass off. I needed the extra sleep...</text>

	<text>Yep, mine didn't go off this morning. Had thought that this only affected alarms set before the new year? Obviously not.Still, not so bothered by it as think it's a result of some terrible practices in cupertino. I'd hate to see what their codebase is like if something as simple as an Alarm app has these sorts of issues.PS, all you folks with your multiple backup alarms are totally insane.</text>

	<text>I don't think we can blame the people whose alarms did not go off. After all, Apple issued a statement that everything would be fine by today... as if they knew what they were talking about.If a company issues a statement like that after a problem has been reported, I am not sure if people should be blamed for being naive. After all, they are looking through their $500 shiny looking glass at a $300 billion firm.</text>

My custom sounds (ringtones) didn't work and strangely enough my girlfriend's stock sounds didn't work either.I'm out of ideas and she's been late to work twice in 2 days.I know the critics will say, &quot;shame on you for using it 2 days in a row&quot; but please...I tested it yesterday with custom sounds and they worked fine.  It's overnight that is causing the issues.</text>

The alarm setting doesn't even have a day or date in it unless you repeat it automatically and then its only the day you're setting not the date? Why would the alarm clock need to store the whole date including the year in its alarms?It seems to me that this &quot;bug&quot; has uncovered a more serious issue. Why is Apple making their software more complicated than it needs to be? What could the alarm also be doing so that it needs to know the date it was created or changed...</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byakbI'm a CS graduate from one of the best universities in England, with 8 years experience in software engineering. So please don't insult my aptitude.It *is* utterly unforgivable. This is an introduced bug in iOS4. If the phone can render the time and date without problem - which it can - then there is absolutely no excuse for the alarm to fail. All it has to do is check that.It's totally basic.It's not even as if this is the first time the alarm system has been shown to be buggy in iOS4. After the daylight savings problems - across the world, with multiple opportunities on multiple dates to issue a fix I might add - we've also had Apple's announcement of a couple of days ago that it was no longer an issue as of 3rd January.Bugs happen, fine - of course they do. Bugs like this should get fixed much quicker by a 300 billion dollar company relying on this OS to drive future growth. Even if only for PR reasons.Don't be silly. I've got plenty of brains, and an alternative, but it's sure as hell still worth complaining about.This is one expensive piece of kit - and this is one freakin' basic piece of functionality that should never, ever fail.Strangely, not everyone has been bitten by this bug.  For example, I use my iPhone as my *only* alarm clock, and it has gone off as expected every day.  In fact, I set it without thinking about it over the weekend and had to shut the thing off so I could sleep in.  Obviously, there's something subtle and sporadic going on here.Also, I'll assume that in your 8 years experience, you've probably never had to write a full-featured calendar/alarm application of any sort, so you don't actually know how many edge cases and corner conditions actually have to be handled.  Oddly, I can't think of any off hand that would be triggered by 2011-01-01 through 2011-01-03, but the odd range of the issue speaks toward an odd problem.</text>

	<text>Ok, I had a weird alarm experience this morning (1/4).Yesterday, I remade my main alarms after I found out you had to delete the old ones and make new ones for the bug to go away. I have two: One non-recurring one for medication that's generally set for 2am and one recurring one for waking up at 7:30am on weekdays. I had them both activated last night before bed. They were both set to play the default Marimba.I woke up on my own around 2:50am this morning a realized I never was woken up by the alarm tone. I'm a light sleeper so it's not like I could have slept through it. The pop-up notification for the alarm was on the phone when I pressed the home button, but the actual Marimba alarm tone never played. I was a little frustrated as I missed my target time for the medication, but it's not the end of the world.Since it was close to the time, I then adjusted the same alarm for 3:00am to see if it would do the same thing (pop-up, no tone). A few minutes later when 3 rolled around, the alarm functioned 100% normally. Weird.The recurring 7:30am alarm worked just fine.I can't tell if this is the same bug as everyone has been complaining about or something new. The situation seemed unique but I can't tell.</text>

We have memory to burn and there are better ways to save memory than just cutting 3 numbers.Since the alarm clock doesn't even care what year it is, that seems highly unlikely.  Besides, I'm about 99.999% sure that's not how NSDate works.</text>

	<text>Call me a victim of modern society, but I rely on my phone to wake me up in the morning. Given that it is marketed as so much more than a phone, I don't think it is unreasonable for me to rely on it to wake me up in the morn.Twice in as many months it has let me down. Would I be unreasonable to request a nice little alarm clock from Stevo (probably analog, or at least without a date function might be best if coming from Apple)?</text>

Unfortunately I forgot to set it Sunday night, and woke up the next morning to a text from my boss asking if I was alive.</text>

	<text>Pau Gasol appeared to be sleep-walking through much of the Lakers' embarrassing loss to the Memphis Grizzlies at the Staples Center on Sunday. It turns out that might not have been too far from the truth.More on the LakersFor more news, notes and analysis of the Lakers, check out the Land O' Lakers blog from the Kamenetzky Brothers. BlogA team official confirmed Tuesday that Gasol missed the team's morning shootaround for that game without permission and later claimed to have overslept.Three Lakers in all said they did not get up on time because the alarm clocks on their iPods malfunctioned that morning, sources said, but Gasol was the only one who didn't show up at all.</text>

How is it my fault for paying for an expensive phone with &quot;the most advanced mobile OS&quot; and it can't even do what my cheap old Nokia phone could?Come on guys, we understand that bugs are inevitable.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byswoloiuJust give up on using your iPhone as an alarm clock,alarm bells for Apple as glitch hits new year wake-up calls for iPhone usersOne of the running jokes about the iPhone is that it&rsquo;s amazing, unless you actually want to use it as a phone. I guess it doesn&rsquo;t make a reliable alarm clock either.iPhoneowners already encountered an alarm problem back in November, when the switch to Daylight Savings Time caused some repeating iPhone alarms to go off an hour later. Apparently the New Year&rsquo;s switch has caused problems as well &mdash; and they were even worse, since the alarms didn&rsquo;t go off at all (rather than just being delayed), and they affected iPhone owners who set their alarms manually (not just the ones who relied on an automatically repeating schedule).You can add me to the list of people affected. My alarm didn&rsquo;t go off yesterday, but luckily there was no pressing reason for me to wake up. This morning it worked just fine &mdash; until I hit the snooze button and overslept anyway.Kerys Bessell, from Basildon, Essex, said: &ldquo;Myself and my boyfriend were late for work this morning due to this fault. We both work for the ambulance service and because of the fault a front line ambulance was unmanned until we got there.&rdquo;While theiPhonealarm problems are getting plenty of coverage, they probably aren&rsquo;t as embarrassing as &ldquo;Antennagate,&rdquo; where Apple decided to offer free iPhone cases to offset reception problems with the iPhone 4. Yet the phones sold like crazy, and Apple couldn&rsquo;t manufacture them quickly enough.snif, snif - is that troll i smell?</text>
