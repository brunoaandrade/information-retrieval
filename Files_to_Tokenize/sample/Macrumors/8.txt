	<text>Several months ago,we notedthat major GPS company Garmin was considering developing iOS applications after abandoning its partnership with ASUS to produce Garmin-branded phones, and it now appears that Garmin has followed through on those plans.Garmin todayannounceda number of new standalone GPS products and iOS and Android applications, with the most prominent of those applications beingGarmin StreetPilot[App Store, &#36;39.99] for the iPhone.The StreetPilot App includes many of the same high-end features available on Garmin's standalone automotive GPS devices like free traffic alerts that enable drivers to steer clear of traffic accidents, road closures and construction; lane assist with junction view that directs drivers to the preferred lane and displays realistic images of upcoming complex junctions; and speed limit indicators that display speed limits for most major roads.Garmin StreetPilotalso supports multitasking under iOS 4 and integrates with users' music libraries and address books.Unlike some of the other mainstream GPS applications for the iPhone,Garmin StreetPilotdownloads map content as needed, as opposed to storing the entire map database within the application.  While the decision allows Garmin to offer smaller downloads that require less on-device storage and quicker download and syncing times, as well as automatic access to the latest map updates, the trade-off is that users must be in areas with data service coverage in order for the application to function properly.</text>

Right?Quote:Originally Posted bycorbijnalI'd say your 500MB data allowance on O2 would be churned up in no time.This should be exactly the same as using the Apple maps app in terms of bandwidth.

If you're not in a 3G area, forget it.  I'll take my chances with an &quot;outdated&quot; map than I will with not being able to quickly access any map at allevery time.</text>

	<text>Not interested - the Tom Tom app is great, and I don't have to worry about data coverage.  When you drive around in rural areas, it can definitely be a big issue.  There are plenty of much cheaper apps that download maps on the fly.  Free traffic is a plus though - that may be the one selling point.  I have to pay a yearly fee with Tom Tom.</text>

	<text>Damn.  The map-download thing is the one thing keeping me from buying this immediately.  I have both TomTom and Navigon's apps and switch between the two from time to time because neither does what I want - basically, I've wanted the Garmin experience on the Iphone but the freedom of the Iphone (and updates, etc. the apps have allowed.)My guess is that the maps download to your phone and are not constantly being pulled in, so a mapped-out drive from one city to another that passes through a dead zone isn't going to result in an area with no maps.  But that one small issue of getting stuck in a no-coverage area and desperately needing it is worrisome.That said, Garmin has everything else covered here -traffic, map updates, etc.  The download issue really should be a minimal problem for most people who aren't traveling in iffy areas.  I *really* want to get back to using a Garmin product without buying a standalone unit.</text>

Maybe allow current route to be updated with EDGE/3G while whole database updates require Wi-Fi.  Just my 2Â¢The problem with this plan is that they're specifically bragging about stuff like construction updates, points of intrest, and traffic alerts.In other words, you'll have a system that's constantly downloading stuff AND taking up 3 GB on your phone. I'd be happier to pick one or the other and not have to have the worst of both plans.Your idea could work for another GPS app that's not built to highlight those kind of things, but that doesn't seem to be the app that Garmin wanted to make.Quote:Originally Posted bymalnarMy guess is that the maps download to your phone and are not constantly being pulled in, so a mapped-out drive from one city to another that passes through a dead zone isn't going to result in an area with no maps.  But that one small issue of getting stuck in a no-coverage area and desperately needing it is worrisome.That's something I'd like them to clarify, actually.Is it like Google maps and just downlaods &quot;where you are&quot; or is it downloding your whole state and the surrounding states? Or, like &quot;North-East&quot; or something like that?The difference between those 2 systems could actually mean a lot for some of you folks, it seems.</text>

Just my 2Â¢Tom Tom is moving towards this... the latest version allows users to submit map update info, and then allows other users to download that info.  I'm not sure what it includes because I haven't played with it, but I have noticed it downloading the updates for me every couple of weeks (over 3G, not wifi).  It asks when you start up if you want to download the updates.</text>

	<text>Garmin, a little late to the game aren't we?As for downloading maps on-the-fly, bad decision.  True, I went many years using Google Maps for directions without major problems, but there definitely were some major headaches along the way.  I can remember critical times when the I would be staring at a blue dot amongst a sea of gray.  I mean, I still alive, so it couldn't have caused much trouble, right?</text>

	<text>Yeah, Tom Tom is finally getting this right after all kinds of problems. Once a week (if you choose) you get prompted to download a 1 meg'ish patch. You can do it anywhere and it patches the existing stored maps, no live feed necessary. Takes about 5 seconds.You do need live feed for traffic, but of course, that is the whole point of that.BTW, their traffic is awesome now and the routing bugs are finally fixed. Also, their crowd sourced arrival times are the most accurate on any of the platforms and it consistently chooses the shortest route.I was a Garmin lover and wanted it to desperately come to the iphone, but not with maps like this. Now that Tom Tom is finally getting it right, I won't be getting this.</text>

Can anyone tell me why you would want to purchase one of the Garmin/Tom-Tom apps?Google Maps will give you directions, but will not give you a turn-by-turn 3D view that tracks your position and shows you which lanes to get in, etc....  Google has a turn-by-turn nav app for Android though.Also, Navigon and Tom-Tom will download all the maps you purchased with the app, so you have access to maps even when hiking or driving on a remote trail where there is no service available.  Both Navigon and Tom-Tom are moving toward a model where if the map is wrong you can report that it is incorrect and they can fix it faster and provide updates.Real-time maps means they are up-to-date, when you have network (similar to Google Maps).I think Garmin failed on this one -- additionally the interface looks a bit cartoony.</text>

Traffic updates?  Road directions?  Talking to you?  All fine things but I have also been using Google maps this way and have had refresh problems in areas of otherwise good coverage.  I would pay for a map service which had a small local map (say one in a 200 mile radius of your main zip code) that I could have on board.  Using over the air, I'll just stick with free google maps.</text>

I'm currently using navigon on the iPhone as my Garmin unit is a bit flakey these days.Sort it out Garmin please!  Hopefully this will be rectified before the app is available in the Uk store.....

	<text>I picked it up. I let you know how it is. I've never bought TomTom or Navigon, because all I've ever had was Garmin devices, and it's AT LEAST $10 cheaper than any other GPS app with Canada maps as well as US. (I like to travel to canada on occasion). The constant updating for free is a major plus, that's the one thing i missed about my old non-smartphone VZ navigator.As far as the no onboard maps...that's a bit of a concern. Most of my driving is done within a 3G coverage area, but I've read that it has a way of keeping the maps downloaded even if you drop data coverage. Hopefully this is true.EDIT: here is the link for that article i read:http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;sourc...wxKoJ2qD8HahKQQuote:I will cover Garmin's method of handling maps when a phone is out of data range in my review.At least it is hopeful then...</text>

	<text>A year or two ago I too would have lambasted the decision not to include maps, but having seen how HORRIFICALLY bad Navigon's POI database is I'll gladly take downloaded maps if it means when I search for something I can actually find it.  Navigon mitigated this some by utilizing google search, but it's still pathetic that I can't find 80% of the nearby businesses in Navigon.I've been through 3 Garmin's and loved every one of them.  Since my last one was stolen I've lived with Navigon my iPhone.  I've never felt it was worth paying for between the horrible iPod integration (volume, podcasts) and pitful POI database.Assuming there is some caching of maps I think it'll work great, even if the caching isn't persistant (ie. even if it had to download the map from my house to work every day...  oh wait I work from home, but you know what I mean right?).</text>

Maps are good turn by turned was flawless. Checked out how current the maps where by going through a new subdivision only about 2 months old and it found all the street names no problem.</text>

	<text>I'm sure that this works for a lot of people, but not me.I travel frequently in the Adirondacks where there NO AT&amp;T service, not even Edge.  The whole concept of the ADK region is for it to remain pristine forest and mountain, unspoiled by cell towers.  That concept isn't going to change without a NYS Constitutional Amendment, and that is not going to happen in our lifetime.I think the whole point of having GPS on the iPhone is to be able to get maps as needed.

	<text>Wow, all the critical reviews to pay or not to pay, pre installed or dl on the fly.  As I see it, both have draw backs as mentioned, but my general pref, is that it should dl at least your surrounding area.  So    Garmin (39.99), Tom Tom (39.99), Navigon (44.99),Google (free), Motion X ($2.99)etc. for US major apps.And yet not one sole mentionsMap Quest 4 Mobile (free), dl on the fly and I have never had an outage issue.I do prefer a stand alone gps though. Therefore I don't see spending more for a secondary gps/backup on my mobile.And for what its worth, currently using a Garmin 265WT, with traffic. I do have some slant toward Garmin as I use a eTrex Vista.  On the iPhone I have all the bold apps.  I prefer the Map Quest of all the boldfaced ones.Changing gears on subject, GPS IIF, SV-1 launched  end of May 2010 and SV-2 soon, accuracy will only get better!</text>

I can imagine they also have some sort of cash so you only have to d/l the map once and then it lives in your iphone. It also has an amazingly small footprint - weighs in at only 8mb and this is another cool feature of the program!Besides, none said you cant have garmin for live updates and news + navigon or tomtom as a standalone gps.I like Garmin's approach, wish they make it for Europe as well</text>

	<text>If you live in the northeast I can tell you definitely there are many places where data coverage goes out - it's just a fact of terrain. There are many places where you would need a cell tower every hundred feet to have complete coverage - and that ain't happening. I'll give you and example - Greenwich, CT has terrible data coverage - this is a rich area, maybe 35 miles from NYC and data coverage is terrible. I've seen it first hand, this not speculation.I use TomTom - it has all the maps of the US and Canada - it works in the middle of nowhere in the backcountry even without cell or data coverage.Now - to be out in the middle of nowhere and have the app say it needs data - and that you can't get your street or turning info - well that is just profoundly stupid. They need to have the option to download at least your full region within 200 to 500 miles - otherwise I just would not trust it as my gps system. No way. Case closed.</text>

It also has an amazingly small footprint - weighs in at only 8mb and this is another cool feature of the program!Well, that's the real question, isn't it.  If it turns out this is the case, and it can cache the maps for an entire region, and if it's smart enough to grab the maps for the entire region that you're currently in and/or going to, for some appreciable radius, AND if it can keep the maps in the cache for as long as you need it (which might be &quot;forever&quot; for maps of your home city), then I'm willing to give it a try.But others in this thread have already talked about driving through backcountry areas with no 3G access, and not having any access to maps.  They've talked about travelling down a highway and &quot;running out of map&quot; and having to pull over so that the 3G can connect and refresh the maps.  If that's the sort of user experience I should expect, then I'd rather stick to a standalone GPS receiver.  Or buy one of the other GPS apps that have built-in offline mapping.Garmin touts the ability to get the latest map updates and real-time traffic.  Definitely useful for navigating within big cities with major highways, constantly-expanding suburbs and major road expansions in the works. But without map prefetching and caching, they are making their GPS app ONLY useful for these areas.Eagerly awaiting real-world reviews...</text>

	<text>Always good to see more options. But my Android friends relying on Google navigation find themselves up a creek due to this same issue of network dependence. While my pre-stored Navigon MyRegion for iPhone keeps on navigating! 3G has small dead spots even in major cities, and that&#8217;s enough to miss a turn.In fact, my old iPhone 3G that doesn&#8217;t even have phone service anymore still works great as an in-car voice-guided GPS with Navigon. (Just don&#8217;t put it into airplane mode&#8212;that saves power but seems to shut down the GPS as well as the other radios.)MyRegion is cheap (it&#8217;s regional but upgradable) and it even goes on sale sometimes&#8212;I&#8217;m really happy with it. Very slick iOS UI, but in a non-distracting black-and-brown. (Unlike the cluttered, garish UI that Garmin app seems to have.) And it multitasks nicely with Pandora AND any other GPS app I want! Sometimes I run Navigon MyRegion in the background for the voice guidance, while Google Earth is in the foreground showing me the real photographic landscape. Two GPS apps running at once can be the best of both worlds</text>

	<text>As a long term Garmin user I cringed when they tried doing the phone thing with Asus, this doesnt fill me with any confidence either.As mentioned above, signal where I am in the UK is just too patchy to rely on, or indeed fast enough (even when signalisgood).When iPhones only had 4/8gb storage then it kind of makes sense but as later models are all 16gb+ whats the big deal?I like to holiday in the US, often driving long distances. OTA maps would cost me a fortune in roaming fees, if indeed I got signal out in the sticks.For me buying copilot outright (Â£25/$40) for the UK and (Â£10/$15) USA (Thanks Black friday sales!) made a lot more sense and a fixed budget. I get quarterly updates too so I'm neverthatout of date!Before NDrive were given the boot I recall I got their USA/Canada maps for about $5 all in. Unless youreallyneed all the available space for music/games/etc why would you want to risk it all on the chance of a good signal?</text>

Both Navigon and Tom-Tom are moving toward a model where if the map is wrong you can report that it is incorrect and they can fix it faster and provide updates.Real-time maps means they are up-to-date, when you have network (similar to Google Maps).I think Garmin failed on this one -- additionally the interface looks a bit cartoony.Mapquest has a really nice google style that gives you turn by turn with voice for free.</text>

	<text>Like my Nuvi for the Garmin interface and have been waiting for an iPhone app to take its place. Have used Google maps and like others stared at the blue dot in a field of grey where no map has loaded due to slow or no cell coverage. Garmin dropped the ball on the decision to not load the map data as a package. All of North America is around 1GB on my Nuvi and I'd gladly devote that space on my iPhone. Whats more our iPod 4G could have been a nice GPS in my wife's car with the maps loaded. No cell connection for the iPod means no maps and no way to use it for a second Garmin purchase. Lost revenue from our two devices Garmin but if you guys in Kansas fix that problem and have all of the map data included you've got two more sold!</text>

	<text>You know, I have had good enough experiences with Garmin that this app would have tempted me to consider buying despite the fact I already have Navigon (and am on a budget so I should just stick with what I have) but the fact you don't get downloaded maps is a total deal buster.I can get that for free with Mapquest including voice instruction to tell me when to take the next turn. Sure, Garmin may  have better routing, maybe their interface is better (don't know), but that's not worth 40 dollars more.On top of that, if I am going to pay for a navigation software (since even if Mapquest didn't offer turn by turn for free I can at least use google maps that comes on my phone for free), one of its uses better be good for travel. And while Garmin's app probably would be fine for around town for me (as is the free google maps), trying to drive out of town would be an issue cause I live in a mountainous area... there will be plenty of areas around me without cellphone coverage that I might want to take a drive through. And I don't want to pay 40 dollars for a navigation app that won't help me in those areas. Especially when I can pay less than that (Navigon is now 35 for all of the US) and get a program that isn't crippled that way.Personally, I think it was a *huge* mistake for Garmin to rely on downloading only. Even if you don't have a need for the maps to be on your phone, you can get the same function for free from other apps. And if you are willing to give up voice instruction, you don't even have to download any apps, you got google maps that comes with the phone. And from what I understand from reviews, this isn't download a map and it caches it, this is pretty much like google maps where you have to have cellphone connection to have a map.</text>

	<text>There ia another HUGE drawback in the decision to have over-the-air maps: the roaming fees. If I travel in my country downloading a map can be a boring stuff but you can live with it (although I have to admit that I would not rely on hoping to have cell service in the area where I have to go), but if you go outside the country downloading anything can really boost your cell fees. Imagine to plan a trip from Milan to MÃ¼nich (a 5 hour one, not so long) where you have to download data from (in sequence): Italy, Switzerland, Lichtenstein and Germany cell networks...I imagine that a single trip like this can boost your bit up to several hundreds of Euros...REALLY BAD!Not buying this...</text>

I'd pay to have good navigation on it. So why the hate from Garmin?I think I have the hardware, don't I? I can receive 3G data, which also means my iPad has GPS. Isn't that enough?</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bydjinnI would say the app has some potential but needs a lot of work.  No need to name all the issues since they are obviously already mentioned in the thread.I encountered a lot of &quot;WTF?&quot;-style behavior quirks with Garmin myself. It does the job, but the deal-breaker for me is that the volume slider in settings sets both your device volume, and the speech volume. So you either deal with quiet music, or very loud instruction if you are using your phone to also play music.It handles drop-outs of network fine, but requires you to be on the network to get a route planned, and you can't pre-plan a route. So if you are say, planning a camping trip, you will only get GPS direction one way if the camp site is out of cell service (like mine usually are).</text>

	<text>This has been available for over 2 years on the Blackberry and it also downloads the maps. First off it must cache a lot or they are very small files because it starts plotting your direction almost instantly (couple of seconds). Also, I am on Verizon and when on a phone call we don't get data, however this continued to work flawlessly, as long as you already entered in your destination. This is one of the greatest uses of multitasking since it will run in the background and give you voice commands even if you are checking email or doing something else. This is also a great price, I had paid $80 for the blackberry version. It is worth it since it includes the latest maps (usually something you have to pay for), has the exact same functionality as the dedicated box, and is must cheaper.  One negative is it drains your battery pretty good so make sure you have a car charger. But it has been great because I always have it with me.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bywwchrisYeah, Tom Tom is finally getting this right after all kinds of problems. Once a week (if you choose) you get prompted to download a 1 meg'ish patch. You can do it anywhere and it patches the existing stored maps, no live feed necessary. Takes about 5 seconds.You do need live feed for traffic, but of course, that is the whole point of that.BTW, their traffic is awesome now and the routing bugs are finally fixed. Also, their crowd sourced arrival times are the most accurate on any of the platforms and it consistently chooses the shortest route.I was a Garmin lover and wanted it to desperately come to the iphone, but not with maps like this. Now that Tom Tom is finally getting it right, I won't be getting this.Also, Navigon and Tom-Tom will download all the maps you purchased with the app, so you have access to maps even when hiking or driving on a remote trail where there is no service available. Both Navigon and Tom-Tom are moving toward a model where if the map is wrong you can report that it is incorrect and they can fix it faster and provide updates.______________________how to copy xbox 360 gamescopy xbox 360 games]</text>

I got the garmin too. I have only used it a couple of times but what I can say is, it seems to download the entire map at the beginning of the trip (when you most likely had coverage).Yesterday I was using it in a place that just started construction and the directions took me on the detour! I like the garmin plus the included free traffic works well.</text>

	<text>I concur with JayInNJ. I have been using the BlackBerry version with my Storm (1st-gen) on Verizon for two years now. OTA maps have not been an issue for me in all this time. Of course, I don't travel to the middle of nowhere. So, YMMV. I'm planning on getting the iPhone when it launches on VZW and will most likely get the Garmin app for it. $40 for the iOS version with additional features (traffic, Lane Assist, etc.) is a great deal compared to the $75 I spent for the BB version.Quote:Originally Posted byJayInNJThis has been available for over 2 years on the Blackberry and it also downloads the maps.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byRaceTripperI drive 5000+ miles worth of road trips each year. AT&amp;T 3G is available for maybe 5-10% of that, and EDGE is mostly useless otherwise. I use Navigon and it works great. A GPS program that relies on live downloads would be a comlete disaster for me.Know what you mean. I recently did a road trip from Cali to Arkansas with my Navigon app. I dont know what Id have done if I had to rely on data for the map info. Its really quite a shame. Ive owned Garmin units for years before switching to iPhone and Navigon. Why Garmin?.....Why?</text>

	<text>I just use map quest application. It is a free application and offers voice-based turn by turn directions with street names and all. Traffic updates really aren't worth the extra $40 if you ask me. And half the time I shut off the screen and just listen to the voice direction to save battery life, so 3D maps are a mute point with me... OTA map pulling really isn't all that bad. It loads your entire route when you load your destination (unless its extremely long, like cross-country) so if you don't deviate from its directions, you won't need service again to pull directions.I have only had 1 issue on OTA map pulling with Map Quest. I once took a different way then suggested and caused the unit to re-rout me automatically. However, at that moment I didn't have service (Thanks AT&amp;T, I was in NYC...) so the app prompted saying &quot;re-routing not available at this time&quot; and then 1 minute later it re-rerouted me when I got service. Not bad. It does everything I want it to. The only thing I wish it had was traffic updates. I have no idea why anyone charges for this. We should get it free with our data packages...Anyone know if there is a jailbreak version of this app or will it not work because it is authenticated on the server side?</text>

We should get it free with our data packages...And this is the point why it is ridiculous to pay 40 dollars for an app that if you take the wrong turn or decide to do a small deviation that you're left with no directions if you happen to be out of service.Why would I pay 40 dollars for an app that won't be flexible when I'm out traveling when I could pay 40 dollars (or less really, last I checked Navigon was 35 for all of the US) for an application I can use anywhere and if I decide to deviate or some how go off track, it has no issue with that? And I can get an app that does the same thing as Garmin for *free* (mapquest). Any advantage Garmin has over Mapquest certainly isn't worth 40 dollars.Yeah, Garmin might be useful if you only use it in the city. But you know what, my main reason for wanting a GPS app was for driving outside of the city and going on road trips. Sure I use it more often within the city cause that is where I go more and I happen to have it so I use it. But the biggest reason I wanted it was going places I'm not as familiar with (I'm mostly familiar with the city, it's when I leave the area I am familiar with it, I need it the most. Which is going outside the city). In my area, there are plenty of areas (like Mount Rainier) where you just aren't going to get cellphone coverage, period. Not just a small lapse, just isn't there (and no, now that Verizon has the phone, you still aren't going to get coverage in the areas like Mount Rainier, there isn't cellphone coverage period. I'm just using that as one example btw).Garmin made a huge mistake in that choice of how to do things.</text>
