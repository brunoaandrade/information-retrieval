	<text>Boy Genius Reportpointsto aYouTube videofrom smartphone parts firmGlobal Direct Partsclaiming to show a comparison between parts from the iPhone 4 and an unreleased iPhone model that the company suggests may either be the CDMA iPhone 4 rumored for release in the near future or a fifth-generation iPhone.  Due to the presence of a SIM-card slot, which is not required for CDMA phones, it would appear more likely that the device in question is a fifth-generation iPhone if it is indeed legitimate.  It is of course possible that the part is either from a well-done fake iPhone 4 or perhaps an alternate design for the iPhone 4 that was ultimately not used.The video highlights a number of similarities and a few differences from the current iPhone when it comes to interior parts and cables.  A look at the"middle plate"that contains the stainless steel band that wraps around the edge of the device and provides the device's antennas that have been the cause of such controversy on the iPhone 4 reveals a few differences between the two devices : the break points in the frame between the two antennas have been moved to different locations, indicating that the antenna design has been tweaked despite a very similar overall appearance for the new iPhone.  The shift in antenna design has also necessitated a slight adjustment in the location of several other physical features, most significantly the mute switch.Comparison of claimed next-generation iPhone (left) and iPhone 4 (right) showing differences in antenna break pointsThe video concludes with a teaser claiming that more information on LCDs and motherboards is coming on the company's site, with additional information to be released next week.Update: The YouTube video showing the comparison has been removed, citing a copyright complaint from Apple.  Global Direct Parts has also removed its parts listings for the device.</text>

	<text>There's too much detail and similarities showing Apple's construction for this not to be real.  Whether it's an iPhone 5 or just a different version of the iPhone 4 that didn't make it as the final design, though, is anyone's guess.  I think there's a decent chance it could really be the iPhone 5, but sure wouldn't guarantee it.EDIT: It is, however, safe to say it's probably not the Verizon iPhone, unless they do a dual-mode design that can do both CDMA and GSM.  Verizon's iPhone wouldn't need a SIM card slot.jW</text>

	<text>Not saying that this is a Verizion/CDMA iPhone but just because there's a sim card slot doesn't mean that it isn't (if it was a CDMA/GSM Global Phone like the Blackberrys run on Verizon).But who the hell knows, it's probably iPhone 5 exclusively for Cingular (I bet they change the name back). Kidding, obviously.</text>

	<text>I bet this is a Verizon iPhone or the iPhone &quot;4.5&quot;The extra plastic separators are probably their to prevent the &quot;death grip&quot;. Right now the wifi and 3G antennas are right next to each other. By separating them they can be on both sides meaning it would only affect anything if you put a metal case on it.</text>

	<text>Look very closely at the fully constructed &quot;iphone5&quot;You can tell that the holder never completely reveals the side where the volume buttons are where the notch is supposed to have changed. Look when its facing completely forward- you can just barely make out the notch still on the top in the same place where it is on iphone4. The 2 completely constructed phones are just 2 iphone4's.  I dunno whats going on when they're taken down, but when hes showing them totally put together, they are just 2 iphone 4's. Trickery!</text>

	<text>Yep, probably the Verizon iPhone. Apple wouldn't half-ass it with CDMA-only. I'm sure they'd like their customers who travel to be able to continue using their phones outside of the US.Didn't MacRumors even report on Qualcomm's CDMA/GSM hybrid chip? The antenna bands are probably retuned for it also, hence the new notches.</text>

	<text>Looks like this is the white iPhone 4 or the Verizon iPhone 4 (with dual-mode CDMA/GSM) or this is the iPhone 5. Or both. Or neither.Regardless, I don't see how moving the antenna break point from next to the headphone jack down to the area above the mute switch and adding another break point on the top right side of the phone can make any difference with the &quot;death grip&quot; issue:The &quot;death grip&quot; issue occurs most significantly when one bridges the UMTS/GSM antenna and the Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS antenna. Cell-phone manufacturers are, for regulatory and SAR reasons, not allowed to place the bulk of the cellphone antenna at the top of the phone (part closest to the brain), and so unless Apple has shortened the antennas and left a gap along the bottom (which doesn't make much sense), I can't see how this would change the death grip issue at all. Plus, one of the iPhone 4 &quot;gaps&quot; is cosmetic anyway, so who knows.Therefore, could it make sense that this new phone has three antennas, rather than two? The extra break point might be there to separate the CDMA antenna from the UMTS/GSM antenna and the Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS antenna. The bottom section and the right section of the phone could be for GSM, the left section for CDMA, and the top section for Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS. Since the CDMA and GSM antennas will never be on at the same time, there would be no death grip issue when bridging the two with your hand, and since you could never really bridge the gap on the top right corner of the phone, there would be no death grip issue from GSM/WiFi? The only thing of which I am not sure is whether the signal attenuation occurs because you're bridging two active antennas or whether you're just bridging two antennas together (i.e. does bridging an inactive antenna with an active one cause signal degradation or not, or is it marginal).Just my thoughts on that. Maybe it makes sense. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about antenna hardware could chime in.</text>

I dunno whats going on when they're taken down, but when hes showing them totally put together, they are just 2 iphone 4's. Trickery!Yeah I see it too (at around 0:25 when he's only holding the &quot;iPhone 5?&quot;). But how to you explain the two different middle plates? Chinese KIRF?</text>

	<text>The new phone band has an additional section. The top part is now separated by a seam on both the left and right, rather than a single seam on the top. This may be for an additional antenna -- for CDMA.I don't think Apple will sell separate versions for CDMA and GSM. I imagine that they've tweaked iPhone4 like they did for the 3GS: Improvements to speed, more memory, refined antenna system to prevent the death grip, different camera hardware to allow for white (or multiple colours) plates and overall improved/smaller components.I don't expect to see an entirely new phone (iPhone 5) this year, just an improved version of iPhone4, marketed as such.</text>

	<text>To me it looks like an old iPhone 4 prototype.It seems to me that all the parts of the iPhone 4 are better/cheaper/smaller:The port flex ribbon is larger, audio flex ribbon is a lot bigger.The &quot;new&quot; middleplate is made of one more part, this seems complexer and so more expensive to me. The lacking of a back camera hole could mean two things: they reduced the size of the camera wile keeping the same quality (Steve made a big point of the fact that there sensors are big and have a lot of MP so I don't think he's gonna lower the quality of those) or it was a prototype which didn't had a camera yet.I really don't think that a little extra metal band will address signal issues...3 extra screws (4 if you count the one at the missing camera hole) means more costs, and it is very possible that Apple decided that the structure was rigid enough without those.This is just the line of thoughts of my critic mind, I'm not saying that it couldn't be the new iPhone 5 but I really think you can look at it in many different ways.Besides it like a neat way to track down a leak and so this looks more probable to me.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byDiodeOn the supposed &quot;iphone 5&quot; there are now three pieces.  If one of those pieces is dead space (IE not a antenna) then I could see this fixing the issue as you couldn't bridge the 2 antennas any more.You would need four pieces to create true dead space between both antennas, because with three there will always be a spot at which they meet. That spot could be somewhere you are unlikely to touch (the top of the phone) Still, it's interesting to theorize.This seems like it could be an early prototype iPhone 4, as the lack of hole for the camera and extra symmetrical seam (moving the top seam down and adding the seam on the right side) seems like an earlier plan that was scrapped because the extra seam was deemed unnecessary and the seam above the mute switch was deemed unsightly. But again, who knows?</text>

	<text>I think the antennas might be switched now. Small, top part is now WIFI, Bluetooth and GPS and the rest of the metal is for reception, a 30% increase of space. In this case the two bottom black lines are just cosmetic, making the death grip less likely.Unless someone holds their phone by the whole top part.</text>

	<text>I was hoping that the next iPhone was going to be made from liquid metal so that the metal would not permanently dent when the phone is dropped. It sounds like Apple is going to use the liquid metal in new battery technology though.http://hothardware.com/News/Phones-C...dized-In-2011/According to that link, the US is also getting universal charge ports this year as well. The port on the iPhone 5 appears to be a 9 pin like the current one is. That doesn't mean that Apple doesn't plan on using a dongle or something.People are going to learn to hate that dongle eventually though because it would be a real pain in the butt if you managed to lose it.I'm not convinced that it is the iPhone 5. There are often many variants of prototypes made and there is really nothing to differentiate these parts from a future product or a recent prototype.Every time a company does this they sure do get a lot of attention though. Probably not anymore business from Apple but definitely a lot of free publicity.</text>

	<text>I'm agreeing with the people here saying the next iPhone will most likely just be a minor refresh, and this info seems to bear that out.It makes sense from a manufacturing perspective to use a mature design with high yields. It also gives another 12 months for that per-unit cost to keep dropping (if it's a June release).  And we all know Apple likes to have a decent margin.As to CDMA, I honestly can't see them running two concurrent lines.  Especially considering outside the US CDMA is not huge.  It doesn't really make sense to have a Verizon-only model, even with the number of users on that network.  It's messy, and we're running towards the end of 3G over the next couple of years.The big deal would be, I guess, the LTE model that comes out next year.  That gives the networks a chance to build infrastructure and Apple enough time to get the hardware sorted.  I'd also assume a dual-core A4 (A5?) part by that time - this year's revision will likely just run at a higher clock and would probably see release first in the iPad 2.  Not that we'd know anyway, since PA Semi are now part of the Apple 'Cone of Silence'.Of course, this is Apple, so who knows.  I'm just making conservative guesses :P</text>

We have no idea of knowing what this is.Quote:Originally Posted byTime Lessyeah i'm thinking it's an early prototype.Why would an older version suddenly show up?  Extremely unlikely.  More likely is that Apple had all prototype parts destroyed.Also, you don't have loose parts of prototypes laying around like this.  This video is just like the video SmartPhoneMedic released earlier this year of similar iPhone 4 parts.  I'd bet it's a similar situation where a parts vendor somehow got their hands on some of the parts through a relationship with a Chinese OEM.Quote:Originally Posted byrrittersonI like stewart715's take, but I would go one farther: It's a CDMA/GSM phone that will be for sale at both verizon and AT&amp;T.Quote:Originally Posted bythemadrussian&lt;snip&gt; Therefore, could it make sense that this new phone has three antennas, rather than two? The extra break point might be there to separate the CDMA antenna from the UMTS/GSM antenna and the Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS antenna. The bottom section and the right section of the phone could be for GSM, the left section for CDMA, and the top section for Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS. Since the CDMA and GSM antennas will never be on at the same time, there would be no death grip issue when bridging the two with your hand, and since you could never really bridge the gap on the top right corner of the phone, there would be no death grip issue from GSM/WiFi? The only thing of which I am not sure is whether the signal attenuation occurs because you're bridging two active antennas or whether you're just bridging two antennas together (i.e. does bridging an inactive antenna with an active one cause signal degradation or not, or is it marginal).Just my thoughts on that. Maybe it makes sense. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about antenna hardware could chime in.This is exactly what I'm thinking.  We need to realize that when the length of an antenna is changed, so is the tuning.  Unless they cut it in specific fractions, the antenna is no longer tuned for GSM/UMTS.  My guess is we have a CDMA/LTE antenna or CDMA and blank.  OR, the cut the UMTS antenna in half and we have CDMA and UMTS.But here's a question for the antenna experts, if the frequency is the same, could CDMA and UMTS share an antenna?Quote:Originally Posted byJoJoCal19This changes everything. Again.Just a thought, that sim slot could be for LTE. Not likely, but still.I've been blowing off the possibility of an LTE iPhone this year, but I'm willing to consider it as a possiblity after seeing this as well as the antenna changes.Quote:Originally Posted byPablo90And most importantly, did they really need to move the volume-control buttons? Do you guys realize what a mess it will be with the bumpers and other cases?Unbelievable..This explains those leaks of Verizon specific cases.  This alone brings some of the rumors together into some very strong anecdotal evidence.</text>

While not a fan of more than a few of apple's business decisions, i do empathize with them for being angry whenever leaks like this occur.On the other hand, they could build the phone here in the US, (although at a much more significant cost) while at the same time helping to stimulate the economy by creating jobs..so maybe i'm not so empathetic after all.</text>

It's messy, and we're running towards the end of 3G over the next couple of years.The big deal would be, I guess, the LTE model that comes out next year.  That gives the networks a chance to build infrastructure and Apple enough time to get the hardware sorted.  I'd also assume a dual-core A4 (A5?) part by that time - this year's revision will likely just run at a higher clock and would probably see release first in the iPad 2.  Not that we'd know anyway, since PA Semi are now part of the Apple 'Cone of Silence'.Of course, this is Apple, so who knows.  I'm just making conservative guesses :PYou're completely ignoring 85M CDMA users in China that would also like a CDMA iPhone.  And no, 3G won't end in 2 years.  The 3G networks will most likely be up as long as a decade accoring to the carriers.Quote:Originally Posted by3goldensWirelessly posted (Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.5 Mobile/8B117 Safari/6531.22.7)People got to be high if they think Apple would make the same mistake twice.This is just a bunch of horse manure, designed to yank peoples chains.A sucker is born every nano second these days and anyone who believes this crap should be taken out back and shot straight thru the head!When it turns out to be true, can we take you out back and shoot you straight thru the head?Quote:Originally Posted byXtremehkrOnly they didn't with the first three iPhones.Actually, they did on the first 2.Quote:Originally Posted byBilvoxA friend told me he saw the new iphone while doing work with some factory in China, he said the new iphone is skinnier and different in many ways... this must be the verizon ready phone.my best,bv+1Quote:Originally Posted byelhungarianWirelessly posted (Opera/9.80 (BlackBerry; Opera Mini/5.1.21052/22.414; U; en) Presto/2.5.25 Version/10.54)Why.

At the very least, when he takes one away the remaining phone is definately an iPhone 4.</text>

Once again proving the marketing expertise of Apple. Too bad they can't, or won't design a good phone.As a hand held computer the iP4 and upcoming models are great. It's the phone that sucks and that's something that Apple just doesn't care about. It's all too easy for them to blame it on AT&amp;T as they have with great success.You've got to hand it to Apple, they can sell anything.</text>

Change to liquid metal back? More cameras? Washer and dryer hook-up? More buttons to look like a Motorola phone?I think the CMDA phone is important to Apple to get at more market share and they want it out ASAP. I personally don't think we'll see a major form factor change for a while. Better of what's there for sure... but major change... not yet.</text>

An early iPhone 4 prototype, a Verizon specific (which would be odd for Apple to do) design of the iPhone 4, an early look at the iPhone 5 or 4S or whatever tweak, or it could just be a piece of a knockoff.The cycle begins again.

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byreticulateI'm agreeing with the people here saying the next iPhone will most likely just be a minor refresh, and this info seems to bear that out.It makes sense from a manufacturing perspective to use a mature design with high yields. It also gives another 12 months for that per-unit cost to keep dropping (if it's a June release).  And we all know Apple likes to have a decent margin.As to CDMA, I honestly can't see them running two concurrent lines.  Especially considering outside the US CDMA is not huge.  It doesn't really make sense to have a Verizon-only model, even with the number of users on that network.  It's messy, and we're running towards the end of 3G over the next couple of years.The big deal would be, I guess, the LTE model that comes out next year.  That gives the networks a chance to build infrastructure and Apple enough time to get the hardware sorted.  I'd also assume a dual-core A4 (A5?) part by that time - this year's revision will likely just run at a higher clock and would probably see release first in the iPad 2.  Not that we'd know anyway, since PA Semi are now part of the Apple 'Cone of Silence'.Of course, this is Apple, so who knows.  I'm just making conservative guesses :PI like all of what's been said here.  It also got me thinking maybe Apple is going to shift the release timeline of iPhone and maybe even iPod to a date closer to the iPad refresh timeline?  If they release a hypothetical 'iPhone 4S' we'll call it, in a few months, that is more in line with iPad refreshing around April?  This way they can then release the LTE model either that next year around the supposed LTE launching timeframe or after?  Like reticulate says I agree Apple may see this roadmap opportunity of the LTE tech maturing in order to maximize margins.  The iPhone 4S would be a combination GSM / CDMA tech device, as two separate devices would be uncharacteristic of Apple, and also would create more cost in maintaining, not to mention the fact that CDMA doesn't really have much going for it anywhere other than the US.  Interesting all of this is, to say the least.</text>

The fact that there was no hole for the rear camera is IRRELEVANT because the hole that we see on the iPhone 4 is on the front side of the phone. The rear camera would just sit on the metal plate bit where there is no hole. Im willing to bet the new camera is smaller, so there is no need for the hole for it to 'sit in'.Not sure why people are saying there is no hole for the front facing camera either to be honest.My thoughts? yea this is either a prototype iPhone 5 or the real deal.Remember when people were playing down the iPhone 4 last year when we saw the prototype models - people wouldnt believe it so would throw around stupid reasons as to why it couldnt possibly be the iPhone 4.RESERVE YOUR JUDGEMENT, dont just dismiss it.</text>

	<text>My thoughts:1. If it is real, we'll probably see (a) YouTube take down notices shortly (whether they'll comply, who knows), and (b) a 'polite' letter from Apple attorney's to Global (they are in Texas) trying to prevent them from doing more, and (c) a letter wanting the parts back like the prototype last year.2. If information does indeed come out next week, seeing more of the motherboard, cpu etc will tell a ton about whether it is new (e.g. iPhone 4.5 or iPhone 5 etc) or an old iPhone 4 prototype.One would believe that Global knows the internals but can't repeat them yet (for some reason), that would indicate to me that IF Global is legit, it is a next generation phone.  Otherwise, they would know that the parts are old parts and would not have put it out there as something new.  Sure they might get a temporary bump this week, but once it came out as fake, it would not be beneficial.What happens next will tell a lot about whether it is real or fake.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted byGeckotekYou're completely ignoring 85M CDMA users in China that would also like a CDMA iPhone.  And no, 3G won't end in 2 years.  The 3G networks will most likely be up as long as a decade accoring to the carriers.I should probably clarify.I don't think Apple will do a CDMA-only device.  It makes far more sense to have a dual-mode 'world phone' from a manufacturing and sales perspective (I say 'world phone' much like 'world car' - such as the Toyota Corolla or the BMW 3 - a single identical model that's sold in many different countries).  While there is plenty of people using CDMA, it isn't interoperable with UTMS/GSM and has appreciably less carriers in the developed world.  That's an important point if you're trying to build a single premium device that can be sold in as many countries as possible.  Dual-mode fixes that problem.As to 3G ending 'in two years', I mean the high-capacity smartphone network of choice is going to be shifting over to LTE/WiMax.  3G is going to be around for a while, but in the smartphone segment I can see manufacturers and carriers wanting users on the higher-bandwidth, faster connection.  Same goes for mobile broadband in general.  Apple aren't going to jump on that particular bandwagon until the networks are mature and widespread enough anyway.(And this isn't to say I have any problem with CDMA, though I do think SIM-based devices are far more consumer friendly from a carrier portability perspective.)</text>

	<text>It's a believable prototype. Adjusting the seams and bridging the bottom section with a metal strip is a logical solution to the so-called death grip. Also, the white iPhone had opacity issues that could be the result of light leaks through the larger holes not existing on the &quot;iPhone 5?&quot; prototype. Overall, it appears subtle refinements are being tested.The real question is how Apple intends to boost speed again using 3G for the third time.</text>

	<text>By virtue of the simple fact that the mute button has moved by over 1 cm and the volume buttons also appear to have moved oh so very slightly spells death for all existing cases and bumpers. I doubt very much that Apple would do that if they were staying with the same design.Thinking about how Apple behaves, I don't think they are going to create different iPhone exteriors for different carriers, especially ones that have such subtle differences to cause extreme marketplace confusion with cases. That doesn't make sense from a design, manufacturing or branding standpoint. I believe that whatever iPhones we see this year will all share the same look. It makes the most sense for Apple to release a new iPhone 5 that would run on both Verizon and AT&amp;T. One phone design, multiple carriers, massive production runs to maximize margin. That sounds more like Apple.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bythemadrussianLooks like this is the white iPhone 4 or the Verizon iPhone 4 (with dual-mode CDMA/GSM) or this is the iPhone 5. Or both. Or neither.Regardless, I don't see how moving the antenna break point from next to the headphone jack down to the area above the mute switch and adding another break point on the top right side of the phone can make any difference with the &quot;death grip&quot; issue:The &quot;death grip&quot; issue occurs most significantly when one bridges the UMTS/GSM antenna and the Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS antenna. Cell-phone manufacturers are, for regulatory and SAR reasons, not allowed to place the bulk of the cellphone antenna at the top of the phone (part closest to the brain), and so unless Apple has shortened the antennas and left a gap along the bottom (which doesn't make much sense), I can't see how this would change the death grip issue at all. Plus, one of the iPhone 4 &quot;gaps&quot; is cosmetic anyway, so who knows.Therefore, could it make sense that this new phone has three antennas, rather than two? The extra break point might be there to separate the CDMA antenna from the UMTS/GSM antenna and the Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS antenna. The bottom section and the right section of the phone could be for GSM, the left section for CDMA, and the top section for Bluetooth/WiFi/GPS. Since the CDMA and GSM antennas will never be on at the same time, there would be no death grip issue when bridging the two with your hand, and since you could never really bridge the gap on the top right corner of the phone, there would be no death grip issue from GSM/WiFi? The only thing of which I am not sure is whether the signal attenuation occurs because you're bridging two active antennas or whether you're just bridging two antennas together (i.e. does bridging an inactive antenna with an active one cause signal degradation or not, or is it marginal).Just my thoughts on that. Maybe it makes sense. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about antenna hardware could chime in.I don't know if this a real phone or not...BUT the location of the iPhone antenna breaks could make sense to me.First, the iP4 already has the GSM/UTMS antenna at the top (see your photo), as do other brand phones (that was clear when Apple showed the  death grip with other phones). Some were on the bottom, some on the top.Secondly, moving that hot spot seam to just above the mute switch really places it out of reach of almost everyone.  It seems to me from the video that the top band is the Wi-Fi antenna and the U from above the mute switch, around the bottom and along the right side to the top is the GSM/UTMS antenna.So this may be the solution...placing the 'detuning' spot in an unlikely place for one to  touch it.  They may have done other things internally as well.Assuming this is real..P.S. IMO Bridging the two antenna is not the cause...it is just touching that seam.  For example, place your thumb and forefinger of one hand above and below the gap, i.e. bridging the two antennas...no loss of signal...as compared to placing a finger on the gap directly.  Secondly, bridging the gap by the earphone jack has no effect either...yet it is bridging the same antennas.</text>

Secondly, bridging the gap by the earphone jack has no effect either...yet it is bridging the same antennas.Hmm, you are right.  Verrrry interesting.  I think you just nailed it.The ribbon they showed for the i5 that is longer is so that the contact points between the ribbon and external antenna band are separated by the max distance possible.  In contrast, the i4 ribbon was short, meaning that the contact points were both in the bottom left corner of the i4.  This is why bridging the gap in only that corner kills the signal on the i4 - because the ribbon connects directly under your skin to the antenna band.Thus, for the i5 you distance the contact points (of the ribbon to the antenna band) as much as possible, as shown by the longer ribbon. Just for insurance, you put 1 piece of antenna band in between the two that is not part of either antenna and thus its impossible to directly bridge the gap between the two contact points (of the ribbon and antenna band).Tada?</text>

	<text>Imagine how cool the iPhone would look without any of the black separator bars?And how much stronger it would be. It would be nice if Apple could figure out an alternative antenna design that would allow this.</text>

	<text>I think that if Apple were to redesign the iPhone, they would try to improve it. Not just add a few more lines and take out a few screws. This looks more like a old iPhone 4 prototype than anything.</text>

	<text>Words cannot express just how good it is to hear an American using metric measurementsI reckon it is either the CDMA iPhone, sold as a &quot;World Phone&quot; (CDMA out of USA can require a SIM) which will probably run on CDMA and GSM,or it is just a prototype iPhone 4.Either way I doubt they will call it the iPhone 5 unless it comes with other improvements.I'm thinking it is likely to be released at Apple's next big event and it will be available in white (and therefore I will buy it!)</text>

I imagine that they've tweaked iPhone4 like they did for the 3GS: Improvements to speed, more memory, refined antenna system to prevent the death grip, different camera hardware to allow for white (or multiple colours) plates and overall improved/smaller components.I don't expect to see an entirely new phone (iPhone 5) this year, just an improved version of iPhone4, marketed as such.I can actually see this happening. Possibly slightly updated specs, but nothing major, (except for the inclusion of CDMA, or separate CDMA model).</text>

	<text>It's refreshing to see Apple hard at work solving the (perceived) antenna issue after initially denying the problem existed, then saying it's fixed, then posting video to show everybody else has the same problem. That's like saying, &quot;Sure it sucks but so does Microsoft.&quot; Apple is known for setting higher standards. Here's hoping for an even better iPhone 5.</text>

	<text>videos being pulled down is a definite confirmation that this is the real deal.  Whether or not it's CDMA, I think we'll be seeing its unveiling very shortly because Apple usually doesn't start mass production until right before release (and many past leaks seemed to happen very close to release date).</text>

As in it could be a video from a while back right?Another reason the videos could be getting pulled is so that Verizon can protect their products.  The more talk about the iP&quot;V' the less phones they sell until it releases.  Just some random thoughts.  I'm hoping it is in fact the iPhone 4s for both carriers.

No need to waste space for two antenna structures. Even more importantly, how would Apple explain the decreased signal due to the fact that they chopped each of these antennas in half? They wouldn't.</text>

	<text>Someone mentioned this and I think it's important because it probably proves they dont have any &quot;further information&quot; as they say at the end.At the beginning they act like theres an iPhone 4 and an iPhone 5 and then they're going to disassemble the iPhone 5 and show us the parts. It's just two iPhone 4s. There is no seem above the mute switch and the mute switch is still very high compared to the new case shown.I think they only got these parts and there's nothing more to be seen from these guys.</text>

	<text>Wait, if Antennagate was so overblown and a product of overzealous media, why is Apple choosing to change their antenna? Geez, I don't want to re-learn how to properly hold a cellphone again. Once was hard enough. Maybe this next one will come with illustrated directions.</text>

	<text>Sure, It could be a Verizon Iphone, or even the design for the Iphone 5 (or 6) for ATT.I think it's the White Iphone though. It could be designed for the CDMA network as well, being both a solution for the White Iphone and the CDMA/Verizon Iphone.This is why:The holes in the panels are now missing. The issues with the white iphone included leaking light. No holes, no light. They have closed up holes in the top and the bottom as well as in the parts.Just saying, we expected a white Iphone and a CDMA Verizon Iphone. This could be both. But I think the changes have everything to do with the leaking of light.</text>

	<text>I don't think Verizon has anything to do with these being pulled.  If Verizon was so concerned about not selling phones, they would have issued responses to all the major news stories concerning the Verizon iPhone (Washington Post, Forbes, Business Week, etc...).  Its interesting that neither Verizon nor Apple has said a single word against these claims....and this has to be hurting sales, as many people (myself included) are holding out before getting an upgrade.</text>

I too have been holding out.  I was with a crappy local company due to the fact that ATT has no tower near where I live, so I have been awaiting the Verizon iPhone bc we have awesome service here with them.  I have recently switched back to ATT bc I have not being able to use my iPhone 3GS.  ATT has opted to give me a free minicell for my home.  They will have a tower right next to my place in 6 months too...so I may just stick with them anyhow.  I'm so sick of this waiting game!

Geez, I don't want to re-learn how to properly hold a cellphone again. Once was hard enough. Maybe this next one will come with illustrated directions.Why not? Lots of other phones come with illustrations showing how not to hold them too. My wife has an HTC phone, the manual for which shows how certain hand positions will interfere with the reception. As was pointed out exhaustively last summer, this problem is not unique to the iPhone.But, even more interesting to me is how you seem to know definitively that the design differences in this phone were intended to mitigate that so-called problem. Or even better, how you know this isn't a fake to begin with.</text>

	<text>Not sure if this has been pointed out earlier but the start of the video contained a still from the iphone4 launch (I recall it being a shot of Steve on stage). That still is likely to be from the Apple coverage. Hence Apple has a copyright.Not necessarily anything to do with the bits of metal seen later on.Quote:Originally Posted byblack743&quot;This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Apple, Inc.. &quot;Gee does that say something?

W/o the intervention, I think the story would have faded pretty soon. However, by getting the takedown notice from Apple, it implies there is a lot more fire than originally thought and will spread coverage of the story.Before Apple, this was a poorly edited video using trite graphics, now its 'the video that Apple wants to keep hidden'</text>

Although i wouldnt expect something legit this early, we still have 6 months until release.Not sure why people are saying iPhone 4 prototype - we would have seen those months ago.I'm convinced it's NOT the iPhone 5. It's just the CMDA version (Verizon version) of the iPhone and a minor refresh (probably to eliminate the antenna issue) that will probably slip over to the other model too. This is more like the 3Gs version of the iPhone compared to the 3G version.Also... the video has nothing to do with Copyright, but with NDAs. I'm sure suppliers are under strict NDAs not to disclose anything until after announcement. Including channel partners like this company.Full of Win... I get your point and you're right. Apple having this pulled draws attention to it. But, given they are close to announcement, I'm sure they are just trying like crazy to keep the cat in the bag as long as they can.</text>

	<text>Since Verizon cant do voice and data at the same time does that mean that they cant do facetime?  So would that mean that they would have a iPhone without a front facing camera? Maybe that explains the housing with no camera hole</text>

Maybe that explains the housing with no camera holeVerizon came out and said that they are going to update their 3G network to be able to support simultaneous voice and data. Plus, FaceTime is done over VOIP and it's all data. So there would be FaceTime on Verizon regardless.Here's the link to the article talking about Verizon being able to support simultaneous voice and data within the 1st half of 2011.</text>

	<text>Two things; first, its possible they haven't decided how the holes will be in the phone yet; it looks like there's a space for a camera, but they haven't settled on a design.Second, a CDMA iphone will have a camera.  The ipod touch can't do facetime over 3G, but can over wifi.  The fact you can't talk and data is irrelevant to its use.  You can just use the whole thing over data.</text>

	<text>I'm a big believer that a Verizon iPhone is coming and with all the latest info, I believe sooner than June.HOWEVER, relations between Apple and AT&amp;T would have to be extremely bad for Apple to announce a whilt iPhone and the pull it purely for the reason of launching it as a Verizon exclusive.  I seriously doubt we'll see a white Verizon iPhone at launch, but if we do I'll bet AT&amp;T gets one at the same time.</text>

	<text>Hmmm,couldbe Verizon phone.  Looks too well constructed to just be a past proto-type.I don't fault the video for showing two iPhone 4's at the beginning.  Just means they didn't have the whole 'iphone 5', just the innards.  More for effect, really.They could just release it on Verizon in a couple months and have the AT&amp;T version catch up in June.  Then they keep the same release schedule they always have had.  No biggie.  Keeps the buzz going for an AT&amp;T release.Definitelygoing to wait for June to upgrade though.</text>

	<text>Quote:Originally Posted bytullysNot sure if this has been pointed out earlier but the start of the video contained a still from the iphone4 launch (I recall it being a shot of Steve on stage). That still is likely to be from the Apple coverage. Hence Apple has a copyright.Not necessarily anything to do with the bits of metal seen later on.If that were true, the video could have been re-edited and re-posted. There was no need to remove the video entirely if what you say is correct. I'm pretty sure it's because this is something Apple doesn't want anyone to see.</text>

	<text>I don't see why Apple wouldn't change the antenna placement for even the Verizon version. It makes sense that they fix it. I hope this is the Verizon phone. I do prefer the current placement of the black lines though.Also, if this is the 5th generation why wouldn't Apple incorporate the microUSB? This phone will &quot;it&quot; until the second half of 2012. Are they really going to wait until the last minute to address that change? I personally cannot wait for Apple make that change because I hate the ginormous hole at the bottom of my iPhone with all the dust in it.</text>

They will not migrate from the dock to microUSB.</text>

Inc. is an abbreviation that has a trailing '.'.  Combine the 2 and you get Inc..</text>

	<text>Definitely true.  Since the take-down happened.
