	<title>A Push To End the Online Gambling Ban</title>

	<htmltext><a href="http://hughpickens.com/" rel="nofollow">Hugh Pickens</a> writes <i>"Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts has introduced legislation that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/us/politics/26cong.html">would roll back a ban on Internet gambling</a> enacted when Republicans led Congress. The legislation would allow the Treasury Department to license and regulate online gambling companies that serve American customers. Frank's bill has roughly two dozen co-sponsors and the backing of the The Poker Players Alliance, with over a million members. But opponents are mobilizing to defeat the bill including social conservatives and professional and amateur sports organizations, which say more gambling opportunities could threaten the integrity of their competition. '<a href="http://bachus.house.gov/index.php?option=com\_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=805&amp;Itemid=104">Illegal offshore Internet gambling sites are a criminal enterprise</a>, and allowing them to operate unfettered in the United States would present a clear danger to our youth, who are subject to becoming addicted to gambling at an early age,' says Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama and the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee. Another powerful roadblock could be the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. 'Gaming is an important industry to the state, and <a href="http://www.noluckneeded.com/unpopular-harry-reid-faces-online-gambling-question-t8425.html">anything that affects it will be reviewed carefully</a>,' says Reid's spokesman."</i></htmltext>

Wow, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink" title="wikipedia.org">doublethink</a> [wikipedia.org] boggles the mind.
</p><p>
If the gambling ban is repealed, these sites would immediately cease to be "criminal enterprises", and become <em>legal</em> offshore Internet gambling sites.
</p><p>
If the gambling ban is repealed and these sites chose to operate "unfettered within the United States", they'd then become <em>legal, American</em> gambling sites.
</p><p>
The whole fracking <em>point</em>, Rep. Bachus, is to eliminate these "offshore criminal enterprises".  By making it <em>legal</em>, you can bring them <em>onshore</em>, where they can be taxed and regulated, just like state lotteries and privately-owned casinos.
</p><p>
Speaking of privately-owned casinos, at least Sen. Reid of Nevada has a "legitimate" reason to be a roadblock:  He just doesn't want to see Vegas have any competition.
</p><p>
The dumb part about Reid's objection is that the legalization of online poker would bring a lot of new players into the game.  Some of 'em might even end up enjoying it so much they end up going to Vegas to play the game  in meatspace.  Quit acting like the RIAA of gaming, buddy, and you just might make a few more bucks.</p></div>
