Â  Â  The highest issued group as of May 01 2009 is listed here: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/employer/ssns/highgroup.txt [socialsecurity.gov]
Â  Â  You can pull the high group file back to November 2003 from the SSA site here: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/employer/ssnvhighgroup.htm [socialsecurity.gov]
Â  Â  The group numbers are used out of order for "administrative" reasons.
Â  Â  The groups are assigned as:
Â  Â  ODD 01 -&gt; 09
Â  Â  EVEN 10 -&gt; 98
Â  Â  EVEN 02 -&gt; 08
Â  Â  ODD 11 -&gt; 99
Â  Â  Area 000 is never issued.
Â  Â  Group 00 is never issued.
Â  Â  Serial 0000 is never issued.
Â  Â  The Area (state) code is based on where the card is issued, not where the person was born.
If you were born in NYC, but your number was issued in California, you would have a California area (state) code.
Â  Â  Now, the SSN is generally requested by the hospital, so if you have a baby born in the US, part of the stack of paperwork includes the SSN request form.
In those cases, obviously the birth state and SSN state should match, unless for some odd reason the request is sent to another state.
Â  Â  When I was born, there was no requirement to get a SSN issued immediately, and my family moved when I was 5, so my SSN was issued by the second state.
Â  Â  The logic to test if a SSN has been issued is pretty easy with a couple tables in a DB, or a whole lot of hard coded crud that has to be updated monthly.</sentencetext>

<tokenext>How...hard is it to strip non-numeric characters from a string [ SSN ] ?
I can not believe there could be such programmer incompetence ; I once worked on software for a campus e-store for a large university .

These things don't come cheap -- mostly in terms of legal costs.
As in a $5k retainer, $5-10k total for a single patent, more if it takes multiple patents to ensure sufficient protection, and if you want international protection, it can go up to $100k or so.IBM has staff lawyers; they aren't paying standard retainer fees like you are.</sentencetext>
