	<title>Sony Rumored To Be Debuting Wiimote-Like Controller At E3</title>

This isn't surprising, given how dominant Nintendo's Wii has proved to be in this hardware generation. However, many gaming-geeks continue to lament the move away from plain old button-pressing. What is exciting is the prospect that all three companies may incorporate <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw">Johnny Lee-style head-tracking</a> into the next console generation, which achieves a convincing 3D illusion on a regular vid-screen, leaving us just a few steps away from true positional 3D.

	<htmltext>whichever internal security agency decides this is a great way to "monitor" their citizens.

How difficult would it be for such an agency to establish a remote connection to the box in question (PS3, Wii or Xbox) turn on the camera and record away "just in case" somehting nefarious is happening in the household.

I should imagine that it would not be excessively difficult to establish this without adversly affecting the operation of the console.  How much horse power does it take to send a VGA res 1-2 fps video over the net.

Scary thought...  or paranoia?</htmltext>

	<htmltext>Wow.  First off... how sad to be a loyal supporter of a <b>corporate entity</b>.<br> <br>

Secondly; the PS3 is at 22mil wordwide sales, compared to 30 mil for the 360, and about 50 mill for the Wii.  In the US, the situation is worse; about 8.5 mil PS3, compared to about 17 mill 360s.<br> <br>

The PS3 has rebounded, to an extent.  Eighteen months ago it looked like it would be an embarrassing failure for Sony; now, it is at least competitive.  It will probably never catch up with 360 sales wordwide; it certainly will never catch up in the US.  That is a HUGE failure for a company that was the undisputed leader of the last two console generations; although Sony execs like to blather on about how they are still the market leader (keeping fanboys like you happy), there is no doubt they are tremendously disappointed how this gen turned out.<br> <br>

The blessing is, that when Sony announces their next console, it might be significantly better.  The occasional failure tends to put a company back on the right track.  (By better, I don't mean more powerful; nobody complains the PS3 isn't powerful enough.  I mean with a price point and features that consumers want, and a renewed focus on actual games.)</htmltext>
