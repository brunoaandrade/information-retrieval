	<htmltext>Wha?  I spent forty minutes swapping out a P4 AGP board for a DFI x38 with 2 GB Patriot, an E8500, and a ZOTAC 7600GS DVI piping 1080P to a 46" Toshiba 46RV535U via GBPVR and VGA piping to an Asus 20" monitor running 1600 x 900 simultaneously.  I was drooling the entire time and it works incredibly well with cycles to spare.  I can browse the web and watch The Fifth Element in 1080p at the same time without any lag.  Are you saying I am wasting my time?  There are very few things I'd rather be doing.
<br>
The power supply was good for a socket 775 and I already had a case, monitor, and HDD, so the RAM, MB, Video card, and CPU cost me $400 (from Newegg, of course).  Then again I have dozens of cases and HDD lying around.  Doesn't everyone?

<br>
I'll post pictures when the CPU and video are liquid cooled.</htmltext>

	<htmltext><p>I've just recently assembled a new gaming PC (to make a long story short, I wanted to upgrade my old machine to a new CPU architecture, which meant also upgrading motherboard and memory, but the upgrade hassle factor was so large that I just ended up buying the rest of the parts and making a new PC) and I've go a Quad Q6600 (G0 stepping, the easier to overclock) running rock-stable at 3.2 GHz, when the stock speed is 2.4 GHz (while, thanks to using a passive water-cooling setup - a Reserator  V1, temperatures are below 60C at load and noise is minimal).</p><p>My experience is similar to the one described by the guys in the article - for about $1500 (discounting VAT and converting from GBP to USD) I got a high-mid-range gaming machine* capable of running any of the newest games with max settings and 4xAA (anti-aliasing) at the maximum resolution my monitor supports (1280x1024) with lots of horsepower to spare, and which is comparatively as good as a top of the range machine would be 5 years ago (at the time, that's what you would need to run all new games at max setting at that resolution). If I went for the same relative (versus latest games at the time) capabilities 5 years ago the cost would've been at least 2 times as much.</p><p>(PS: Even though I've reused my existing water-cooling equipment - worth about $200 if new - some of this is offset by the fact that I got a factory-watercooled graphics board, which is between $50 and $100 more expensive than the stock version: anybody not going for a full water-cooled setup would just get the stock version)</p><p>* Specs: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 overclocked to 3.2GHz (watercooled); Nvidia GTS280 (watercooled); 4GB premium (faster) PC2-8500 memory (5-5-5-18) stock speed 1066 MHz (slightly overclocked); 2x250GB SATA2 HDD in Raid 0 configuration (Programs disk) + 1x640GB SATA2 HDD (Data disk); an old Reserator V1 for watercooling with replaced, higher capacity pump.</p></htmltext>

(Ex: Lowcost Asus board with 95w max for cpu.. GRR).. at least you need to be careful and READ specs before buying.
But it's not impossible :D</sentencetext>

	<htmltext>$800 for a gaming PC? I don't think that much was needed for a long time, unless you had to play the latest game on your 2600" screen with a high resolution.
For roughly $300 these days, you can build a machine to play any game you want on a 19" screen. You don't really need anything more than a GeForce 9 (~$100), and a high end X2 (~$60). The other ~$140 is more than enough to get some RAM, hard drive, dvd burner, motherboard, especially if you find a deal on newegg or the like.
<br>
This <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.194454" title="newegg.com" rel="nofollow">here</a> [newegg.com] which is quite a decent machine is only $287 ($322 before rebates). Just add a DVD burner for ~$25, and you're all set.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>When I saw a quad core recommended for a bargain gaming PC I knew I would read about an nvidia card not too far down the list followed by 'gamer/overclocker' ram. Yep it's YAFBBS (Yet Another Fan-Boy Build Story) with no actual useful advice for anyone on a budget. <br> <br>
At the moment a Radeon 4770 would be a better choice, if the not the #1 on bang for buck, as touted by most reputable sources. Highly clockable e7xxx or e8xxx range core 2 duo still kicks quad core ass for less money (easy stable 4ghz), less power draw and subsequent heat problems. What really gets my gall with these kind of websites, is the ram recommendations. That quad core has a 1333mhz bus, thus DDR2 faster than 667mhz gains almost no improvement in memory bandwidth and latency, yet somehow there is a huge market for this kind of crap.
<br> <br>
I hate to sound like a greybeard but back in the day it was all about making dirt cheap parts outperform four-figure parts. Now overclocking parts cost more and are much less challenging to work with. If anything overclocking is boring now, it's all about bling. Remember the Celeron 300A?
<br> <br>
Yep, CL5 800 is just fine. If you want another 5\% in benchmarks you can blow your dosh on CL4 1066mhz. Even if you overclock your FSB speed, you'll watch your bandwidth scores scale up, even holding ram speed at a fixed 800mhz! Even if your FSB is stepping up faster than your ram speed, your memory benchmark scores will continue to go up. It only really makes more sense to come down in latency, 667 CL3 is lower *realtime* latency than 1066mhz CL5, and even reasonable 'value ram' will reach those timings with a voltage boost. Yep the socket 775 platform is that crappy. Spend your money on other areas please.
<br> <br>
No IT professional worth their salt recommends anything above reasonably priced and reliable 800/1066 ram, unless you really are going to push high FSB speeds on a core 2 duo, maybe worth paying a whisker more. You don't really need heat spreaders either, and a strip of aluminum and 3M thermal tape will do the job better than $20 set of aftermarket spreaders.
<br> <br>
Honestly, you could blow this thing away in benchmarks for less money.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>I don't understand why gamers have this die hard loyalty/borderline bias for Intel. Granted, they are better than AMD hands down - they're a bit of an overkill. Unless you're an extreme gamer, you'll never actually need the extra power, and to recommend the Q8400 over the Phenom II X4 940 is odd considering they're usually priced within $5 of each other.<br> <br>

I build a new computer almost exactly a year ago. 4 Gigs of DDR2 800 Low Latency memory, 7200 RPM SATA II hard drive with 32mb cache, an Athlon X2 5000 BE (I just bumped the multiplier from 13 to 15 to get it at 3ghz) and a HD 3870. With the exception of the CPU, everything is is running at stock speeds. These are the games I play:<br> <br>
Call of Duty: World at War<br>Fallout 3<br> Race Driver: Grid<br>NBA 2K9<br>Drakensang<br> <br>

I was sure my computer would be sluggish, but it runs all these games just fine with excellent graphics at a 1680x1050 resolution. The point? At the time of my building, all of the mentioned games were (for the most part) considered "current generation", and my CPU was lumped into the scrap heap with the "only if you have to" parts. When I actually started playing games, I soon realized that my performance was exactly what people said I <i>wouldn't</i> achieve.</htmltext>

Call of Duty: World at WarFallout 3 Race Driver: GridNBA 2K9Drakensang 

I was sure my computer would be sluggish, but it runs all these games just fine with excellent graphics at a 1680x1050 resolution.
The point?
At the time of my building, all of the mentioned games were (for the most part) considered "current generation", and my CPU was lumped into the scrap heap with the "only if you have to" parts.
When I actually started playing games, I soon realized that my performance was exactly what people said I wouldn't achieve.</sentencetext>
