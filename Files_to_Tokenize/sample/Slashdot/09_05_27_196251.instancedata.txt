	<htmltext><p>It's not really the same content. The normal page simply has too much stuff for a good interface on something as small as a mobile device. Much of the UI is missing, such as the left nav bars and the tabs for article history and discussion. Sure, you could hide the extra stuff with CSS, but on a mobile device, where CPU and bandwidth are bigger issues, that's not a good solution. It's just a case of the right tool for the right job.

	<htmltext>Actually of all news sites I find Slashdot loads the best. I'm using a Nokia with a fairly small screen, not an iPhone sized one, and it manages to get the column of stories the right width so I don't have to scroll around (well, other than down), and the same with comments. It could be a lot smaller bandwidth wise of course, and I'd love an m.slashdot.org. But compared to mainstream news sites it is magnificent.
<p>
And what the FUCK is with mainstream news sites' mobile version being so pathetic? m.theage.com.au is just about worthless - it shows about 6-10 stories in a few categories. Why not show the whole paper like the regular site? If I'm on a long train journey I get through the interesting stories (if any) in about 5 minutes...</p></htmltext>

Isn't this what's supposed to be solved by different stylesheets for different viewing devices anyway?
Far as I know support for this is even already built into most browsers mobile and otherwise.</sentencetext>

I am extremely tired of websites suddenly realizing that the iPhone is a cell phone and immediately redirecting me to the "useful" mobile site, which is usually optimized for WAP devices.  Even worse, the majority of them do not allow you to access the fully enabled site in any way, shape, or form.  Look, I can understand that <i>some</i> iPhone users would prefer to see the WAP site.
