(The largest was created by sinking the aircraft carrier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS\_Oriskany">USS Oriskany</a> off of Pensacola, Florida, in 2006.) The Vandenberg was built in 1943 (<a href="http://www.keysnet.com/news/story/105128.html">chronology</a>) and commissioned the USS Gen. Harry Taylor.

For decades the ship served as a missile tracker and space relay. It was used in NASA's Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo projects and the Shuttle program.
