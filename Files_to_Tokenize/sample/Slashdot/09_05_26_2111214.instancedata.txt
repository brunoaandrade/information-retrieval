	<title>Church of Scientology On Trial In France</title>
	<author>kdawson</author>
	<datestamp>1243335240000</datestamp>
	<htmltext>An anonymous reader sends word that a trial has opened in Paris that could <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/25/scientology-france-fraud">shut down Scientology in France</a>. The organization stands accused of targeting vulnerable people for commercial gain. Scientology does not have the status of a religion there, as it does in the US, and anti-cult groups have pursued it vigorously over more than 30 years. The current case is based on complaints filed by two women in December 1998 and July 1999. Three other former members who had initially joined the complaint have withdrawn after "reaching a financial arrangement with church officials." If convicted, the seven top Scientologists in France face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of &euro;1M. The Church of Scientology-Celebrity Centre and its Scientology Freedom Space bookshop not only face a much larger fine but also run the risk of being shut down completely.</htmltext>

Not true. Your constitution prevents your government from passing laws which restrict the practicing of religion. Therefore the US courts must judge what constitutes a religion in order to determine whether a law is constitutional. There might not be an official list of recognized religions written in a book somewhere but, in practice, there must be one built up via legal precedent. Since the article only says "Scientology does not have the status of a religion there, as it does in the US" this is an accurate statement since Scientology cannot be shut down in the US because, as far as the courts are concerned, it is a religion and therefore protected from any law restricting its practice. In France the courts do not recognize it a religion so it has no protection.</p></div>

<tokenext>If you 're dumb enough to spend thousands of dollars on something called a 'Thetin meter ' then it 's your fault.. not the seller 's..It 's not only the case with Thetin meters .
I know some people who have given out real money to persons , that walk around their homes and basements with this so called 'Radon meter'.I mean , how dumb one has to be to believe that in some areas on earth ther would be risk of radioactive gas raising from the ground and ( it being heavier than air ) getting stuck into basements if those are not ventilated correctly.First Thetin meter , then Radon meter... What next i ask you ?
Will some hillbillies spring up from earth that start believing into something called Gravethein or Gravity ?

At least in most areas they will take repairs/improvements to the church etc. into account as donations.  So while all church like organizations do target vulnerable people most of them want to actually help and not to make you better just to get your money.
