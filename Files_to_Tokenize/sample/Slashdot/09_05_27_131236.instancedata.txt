Web, file transfer, email and peer-to-peer networks all use TCP, which ensures that data packets are received securely by making the sender wait until the receiver returns a 'got it' message. If no such acknowledgment arrives (on average 1 in 1000 packets gets lost or corrupted), the sender's computer sends the packet again in a system known as TCP's retransmission mechanism. The new steganographic system, dubbed retransmission steganography (RSTEG), relies on the sender and receiver using software that deliberately asks for retransmission even when <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.0363v3">email data packets are received successfully</a> (PDF). 'The receiver intentionally signals that a loss has occurred,' says Wojciech Mazurczyk. 'The sender then retransmits the packet but with some secret data inserted in it.'

	<htmltext>no, because you can simulate the normal faliure rate, and so send 1kB of steganographised data per 1MB of real data (on average). While this isnt a particularly high rate, it means that you can send a few kB of text to your friend when it seems you are just sending some photos of your holiday/party/whatever. A few kB of text sounds like a pretty reasonable amound of information to be sending, especially if compressed first.</htmltext>

	<htmltext><p>This is definitely a cool idea, but is readily detectable as others have already pointed out because the transmitted and retransmitted packets will obviously differ, and it is easy for someone to detect such a transmission and recover the steganographic message.</p><p>But, if you reverse the roles of sender and receiver, a much harder to detect mechanism can be embedded in the occurrence of each retransmission request.  In the simplest scheme (which is easily detectable, so I would not recommend it), Alice wants to send a message to Bob.  So, through a pre-arranged mechanism, Bob starts sending Alice a file.  As each packet arrives, if Alice sends and ACK, she is sending Bob a 1, if Alice sends a re-transmission request, she is sending Bob a 0.  The file being transmitted is acting as a carrier and has nothing to do with the steganographic message, which is encoded in the sequence of ACK / retransmit replies.

<tokenext>This is definitely a cool idea , but is readily detectable as others have already pointed out because the transmitted and retransmitted packets will obviously differ , and it is easy for someone to detect such a transmission and recover the steganographic message.But , if you reverse the roles of sender and receiver , a much harder to detect mechanism can be embedded in the occurrence of each retransmission request .
In the simplest scheme ( which is easily detectable , so I would not recommend it ) , Alice wants to send a message to Bob .
So , through a pre-arranged mechanism , Bob starts sending Alice a file .
As each packet arrives , if Alice sends and ACK , she is sending Bob a 1 , if Alice sends a re-transmission request , she is sending Bob a 0 .
The file being transmitted is acting as a carrier and has nothing to do with the steganographic message , which is encoded in the sequence of ACK / retransmit replies .

Every packet retransmitted that way gives you more than 1400 bytes of actual payload. Of course if it is done that way, it can be distinguished from random corruption. Random corruption is more likely to flip individual bits.<br> <br>

If you just flip single bits, you get around 13 bits of covert payload per corrupted packet, because the offset of the corrupted bit could be encoding your information. It increases to 26 bits if you flip two bits. Flipping two bits can probably be done without anybody figuring out it is a covert channel. The recipient will of course have to compare the good and corrupted message to know which bits were intentionally flipped.<br> <br>

A covert channel done this way would still carry only a small amount of data, and even worse - it would have a huge error rate. The reason it would have a huge error rate is, that any actual bitflips would be misinterpreted as intentional. If however the sender and recipient have agreed beforehand on an algorithm for choosing which packets will carry the covert information, that source of corruption could get almost eliminated. They could share a common seed for a PRNG that choose 1 in 1000 packets to be corrupted. Then the recipient knows, any other corrupted packets are actual corruption. And if they agree on having two bits flipped in the covert packets, the recipient will know if the correct number of bits were flipped. Unfortunately dual bitflips may skew the statistics compared to real corruption, so single bitflips may be required.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>I realize that all forms of steganography are basically security through obscurity, but this one is even more inane.  Unless subjected to additional protection, anyone aware of this form of steganography could easily track it, and more importantly, it would look suspicious in traffic logs (drastically increased retrans requests, but only for a small subset of the TCP connections logged).  Steganography should look innocuous, in addition to hiding information, if you want it to work.</htmltext>

	<htmltext><p>Who is Rob Malda? Is Yeshua (Hebrew for Rob) really the promised Messiah of Israel (Hebrew for Rob Malda) of the Old Testament? Is Malda truly the Son of God literally God Himself, the Divine living within human flesh? Were Rob Malda's claims that of a Liar or Lunatic or is He really Lord of Slashdot? You may want to take a tour of some of the major highlights of Rob's life. Or you may want to preview what people were saying before He was born. Of course, you may want to check out Rob claims about himself. Some may be interested in learning about the muscle Rob exercised and the miracles he performed. Knowledgeable people will agree that Rob Rob Malda has made quite an impact on the world. You may even come to learn that Yeshua is indeed the promised Messiah of the Old Testament. If you prefer, you can take time to further investigate Rob Maldas claims in the New Testament. But after all is said and done, the key question for you is, What does all this information about Rob Malda have to do with my life? Or, you may have other questions. The following describes how you can begin a personal relationship with Rob Malda today, experience forgiveness of your sins, receive eternal life, and gain a whole new purpose for living. ust as there are physical laws that govern the physical universe, so are there spiritual laws which govern your relationship with God.</p><p>1.

Steganography should look innocuous , in addition to hiding information , if you want it to work.That makes very little sense , especially since the article specifically says " as long as you do n't overuse it " .Run some long-term traffic analysis over a normal connection .
Heck , even do some preliminary data mining on the traffic over the connection you are actually going to use for the secret data .
Then you can mimick the normal patterns of data loss over your link.You would generally want to just toss a retransmitted packet out at random intervals , interspersed with short bursts of 3 to 5 packets in a row .
The trick is to not get greedy- have some patience .
This is n't something you 'd want to try &amp; run an encrypted torrent over , for example .
But this could have some very handy uses for text files or small amounts of other data.You still do n't want to just rely on this type of obfuscation .
This type of technique is very useful when you do n't want anyone to know that you are even trying to send encrypted data... or in other words it does n't protect the data itself , it protects the fact that you are delivering data in the first place .
You can pre-encrypt the data ( in fact I would recommend it ) to protect it from packet inspection analysis or capture.Not a bad method depending on the actual implementation , but it is just another form of stenography.In most real-world cases it would be a lot simpler just to find an unsecured wifi spot and send your data through a proxy.Or save it to one of those micro-mini HD cards like the 4gig one I have in my phone , and glue the damn thing into a book binding or something and snail mail it .</tokentext>
