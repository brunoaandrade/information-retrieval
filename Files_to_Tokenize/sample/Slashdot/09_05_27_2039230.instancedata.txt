The projector has a resolution of 848 by 400 pixels (WVGA) and, since it uses laser-scanning rather than LCD to form the images, it does not require a lens to focus, allowing it to display images virtually in any surface.

<tokenext>Laser projector ?
How can you project a raster image using a inherently vector system ? I do n't get it .
How does it know how big the pixels should be ?
( Or maybe it 's obvious and I just need a beating with the clue stick here ) The light from the three RGB lasers is scanned in rows just like the electron beam in a CRT .
To sweep the angle , a tiny mirror flexes very fast .

	<htmltext>As freaking cool as this is, it has an inherent problem.
<br> <br>
Laser pointers getting aimed at people's faces are bad enough, but this is like having 3 lasers waved around wildly.
<br> <br>
A good number of projectors are used to display a screen to a large audience, while a presenter stands in front of it.  For the presenter, getting the light in the eye is nearly unavoidable.  So with lasers, you're talking serious eye damage if you're in the way.</htmltext>

Adding lasers into the picture doesn't offer anything lucrative even at a Theater set up for digital projection.Theaters using film projectors often use a consumer projector for on-screen advertising, and so the Microvision technology looks pretty good for this if it is bright enough to fill the screen (from a pretty long throw distance).
It doesn't have to be high definition or anything, just watchable and cost less than the existing gear to maintain.
Digital equipped theaters would still use their cinema projectors to display advertising because it is cheaper to do so.The Microvision technology will primarily appeal to the home theater market segment, where enthusiasts are paying much higher costs than real cinemas to maintain their projection system light source.
After the SHOW WX gains momentum as a first generation product, expect to see this technology compete with consumer projection systems, and to become invasive just as the camera has on cell phones and media devices.</sentencetext>

	<htmltext>My guess is that they're still using one or two generation old diode technology in their lasers.  I did some sums a while ago and worked out that, to get the same brighness as my 200W projector, you'd need about a 12W LED.  That's a lot for a handheld device, but it's about the same draw as the screen in my laptop.  Note that this is bright enough for a two meter diagonal display which is visible with the curtains open at any time when the sun isn't shining directly on to the screen.  If you just want a 20" display in a coffee shop, you could probably dial the power back to closer to 2W.  <p>
Ideally, you'd be able to switch between these two modes depending on whether the machine had power.  Imagine a pocket computer that you could use with a smallish (but still bigger than most laptops) projected display while you were mobile and then plug in when you got home and have it use bluetooth input devices and project a display that covered a wall.</p></htmltext>

	<htmltext>My guess would be that it projects as three scanning lasers: for red, green, and blue.  Because they would be scanning across, the field of view as the beams of light move away from projector gets larger (hence larger projection at a larger distance).  However, it also gets dimmer, meaning a 12" projection distance will havea brighter image than a 100" projection distance.  Also, if you're projecting closer, it looks like it will have more definition to the image as well.  Not that the pixel-count will change, but the amount of space each pixel takes up wil be larger, so if it's 100" away, but the image is viewed from 3' away from the screen, the image should look pixelated, as opposed to viewing it from a farther distance.</htmltext>
