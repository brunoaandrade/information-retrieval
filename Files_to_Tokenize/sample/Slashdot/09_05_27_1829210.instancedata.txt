Current HSPA download speeds can theoretically reach 3.6 MBit/sec, according to AT&amp;T executives who <a href="http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/t-boosting-hspa-capacity-ahead-advancements/2009-04-20">commented on the planned upgrade in April</a>. AT&amp;T did not comment on which laptop cards and smartphones will be compatible with HSPA 7.2 other than to say it will introduce 'multiple' devices later this year. Could this be one of the big iPhone announcements to come from WWDC?"</i></htmltext>

	<htmltext>Oddly enough, "direct line of sight" actually decreases the data rate of MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems like HSPA.  As MIMO uses the multiple physical wireless channels created by obstructions and reflections between a set of antennas at both transmitter and receiver to increase the bandwidth, a perfectly clear path hurts your data rate.

<tokenext>I know people are going to argue that cellular wireless suffers from awful latency , making this completely unviable for anything but light web surfing... I 'd like to preemptively note that I 've heard HSDPA has very good latency [ wikipedia.org ] for wireless... at least on paper .
This is merely anecdotal , I also hear others talking about 60-80ms latency , which is * great * compared to other common cellular data technologies such as Edge and 3G .

You can have 7.2Mbps to the base station, but from all accounts, the backhaul from said base stations SUCKS, so you won't get anywhere near that.
