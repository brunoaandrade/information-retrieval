Pandora pulled out at the start of 2008, and YouTube began removing content from the view of UK users last March. <i>"From 1 July 2009, firms will have to pay 0.085p for each track streamed, down from the previous rate of 0.22p. [The] head of the music streaming service We7 told BBC News he welcomed the new charges. 'It's brilliant. Not so much the rates but the realization by the PRS that things have to change in the digital world. Till now it's felt like they were not listening,' he said. ... 'They [the PRS] are getting in touch with the reality of the digital world.' [The PRS's managing director said] 'We've laid our stall out and listened to everyone who would engage with us. We've consulted with the 25 firms that represent 97\% of our revenue over the past six months and have been given opinions from many others. We need to ensure the music artists are paid for their work, but we also wanted to make sure that the framework was in place to enable the digital market to grow.'"</i></htmltext>

Spotify is largely owned by the music industry 30\%+ and the suggestion is from the article that it is not there to make money. Having used it I cannot really understand how they intend to make money from it as the free service works well and the advertising is very unobtrusive, to the point which you wonder about its value to generate revenue....
Will be interesting to see if and how this changes with the new rates...</htmltext>
