	<htmltext>Aren't smoke signals and flashing light based communication inferior to electricity?

How would you encode a message into a fuse without the use of some electrical device? Wouldn't that mean they have to be pre-determined messages before put into the field?

I'm sure I'm just not understanding the full symantics of how these things work.

I mean, I thought the whole "Fire the Green Flares!" thing has worked pretty well when people don't have a radio.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>It's not much more than a new version of signal mirrors, heliograph, signal fires, etc.

Even a minor power source (such as a hand operated generator) would allow a radio to outperform infofuses.<br>
<br>
The only reason I see for this item, is when you are someplace electricity doesn't work. Of course, then the sensor package used to read the infofuse signal would need power also, and be within 1.5km/0.9 miles. Guess it's not really that good in an EMP field. <br>
<br>
Of course, what about the gear to encode the message?<br>
They are trying to make it simpler and smaller, but it doesn't sound like it's going to be an easy piece of gear to run without electricity. Of course, the troops could be sent out with a packet of pre-recorded messages. Or maybe just extra batteries for their radios...<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm being a little hypercritical, but it seems as if they are trying to solve a non-existent problem with an overcomplicated solution.  <br>(Kind of like trying to move the 15' from your parking space to the mailbox when you don't have your car keys but think you can hotwire the car with a screwdriver...  Just walk over there stupid!)<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's another idea, give the troopies binoculars and semaphore flags. Of course they'd then have to be trained in semaphore, but it's technology that's available and works without electricity, even after your choice of nuclear apocalypse or alien invasion.</htmltext>

I've got a much better scheme: Use 2 parabolic acoustical reflectors pointed directly at each other. One person speaks at the focal point of one reflector, while the other listens at the focal point of the other. Works for 2 way communication. Only potential problem: It may require a laser to line up the reflectors.</htmltext>
