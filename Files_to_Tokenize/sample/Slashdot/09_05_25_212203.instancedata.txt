This is Prostectic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planet Council. As you no doubt will be aware, the plans for the development of the outlying regions of the western spiral arm of the galaxy require the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system and, regrettably, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes thank you very much.
</p><p>MANKIND: [Yells of protest]
</p><p>
VOGON CAPTAIN: There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaints and its far too late to start making a fuss about it now.

This is Prostectic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planet Council .
As you no doubt will be aware , the plans for the development of the outlying regions of the western spiral arm of the galaxy require the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system and , regrettably , your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition .
The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes thank you very much .
MANKIND : [ Yells of protest ] VOGON CAPTAIN : There 's no point in acting all surprised about it .
All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years so you 've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaints and its far too late to start making a fuss about it now .

	<htmltext>The concern here seems reasonable. Local government websites are some of the most poorly designed and hardest to navigate. I could easily see this resulting in problems not out out of malice but out of simple incompetence. Presumably regulations and guidelines should be drafted for how governments should do this. The most obvious thing is that there must be actual incoming links not hidden by either nofollow tags or anything in the robots.txt file to prevent search engine indexing. Also, there needs to be guaranteed backups and permanent searchable archives (which will in some ways make this more transparent than tiny, non-searchable notices in local newspapers). There are probably other simple rules that would be needed but those are the ones that come to mind most immediately.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>Here in Johannesburg South Africa municipality tried the same thing.
When half a dozen subirbs started complaining about a water outage, they were told that it was advertised on the municipal web-page.

I for one certainly will not be spending a day a week looking for notices from each and every new governmental / municipal / departmental website.

There could easily be a designated central point into which notices could be posted, as a poster above hinted at.

But for now, I'm more than likely going to assume the position of "Just because you can see it on your intranet, doesn't mean that it is publicised."</htmltext>

	<title>Public Notice Kiosk Implementation</title>

	<htmltext>I worked at the State level of government as a senior web services programmer and was tasked with improving upon the paper-based process for posting public meeting notices.

Statute required (and still does) that all notices be posted for display in the Capitol building lobby at least 24 hours before the meeting was to take place. Meeting organizers would fax the notices to our main agency fax line and whoever was currently working the front desk was responsible for collecting and posting the notices.

Unfortunately, the building hosting the fax machine and the capitol lobby were located almost a mile apart. This meant that the front desk staff would have to walk the notices over to the other building several times a day to avoid missing any 24 hour notice requirements.

An ADA accessible touch screen/voice kiosk was setup in the Capitol lobby to display notices and was integrated with the existing intranet CMS system. An electronic form was provided at the kiosk and on our public site for people to request meetings and all submissions and staff approvals in the CMS system were tracked for auditing purposes. System  was backed up everyday, and previous requests were archived in an online repository also accessible from the kiosk.

Making sure that government services are available to everyone is a huge consideration when implementing tech based solutions in government. There is the real possibility of a citizen suing state agencies for discrimination due to federal disability discrimination mandates/. For this project it meant that we had to continue to offer the fax and phone submissions regardless of the additional functionality and efficiency the kiosk/cms solution provided. Desk staff had to key the form data received via fax and phone into the CMS by hand.

This was almost 10 years ago and the system is still in operation. Process has been re-evaluated several times since then to fine tune different aspects of accessing the notices and to address system failure points as they were discovered.

An extremely uninteresting project overall, but a great insight into government work-flow in general.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>Not only do we not get the local paper, but many here have given up on it. I would not be surprised if it goes belly up soon.

I talked with a fellow who was getting it for FREE and he canceled it!

I think that publishing thing in the local paper and NOT on the city web site is a way that the city hides what it wants to do.

We had a red light camera ordinance that was tabled and everyone thought it was dead brought to life quickly without additional public notice even in the paper. Most of the local officials in the city are about to be voted out this year in elections because of this and a new ordinance is  about to be put before voters to make it mandatory that any violations that the red light camera detect be given to the offender by a policeman on the scene. So it makes it necessary for a policeman to be present, making the use of the red light cameras inconvenient and impractical.

But not that many residents even knew anything was going on with these cameras in the first place because the first notice was posted in the local paper that few even read.

I'd like to see it made mandatory that governments publish news, laws, etc. that affect the average person on official web sites. Maybe also in local papers, but definitely on the web. Maybe even provide it in an optional RSS feed.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>&gt; eschew newspapers and post notices of public record on their own Web sites.<br>
<br>
This will be great for the Aussie Government. Public servants are supposed to advertise externally so all appointments are competitive, but they typically pick a buddy or relative for the job. The external advertising is a real pain because it gets applicants who might get the job.<br> <br>

No problem! They convene an "Interview Panel" populated by the buddy's friend and three other disinterested public servant chair-warmers who have no interest in the outcome. They advertise for some poor saps to go through the interview process without realising they're wasting their time. The guy makes sure the panel chooses his mate as planned, but the interview is still a waste of every ones time: the saps and the chair-warmers. Advertising will avoid this charade. Yay for Government efficiency.<br>
<br>
Summed up here: "Government and councils only advertise a role because they are legally compelled to. They usually have an incumbent in the position, an acting who is taking up the role or someone already lined up. Unless you exceed each part of the person spec by a country mile, you're only wasting your time."

</p><p>
EDGAR now has a user-friendly interface and a search engine, but underneath is a huge
collection of raw SGML files accessible via FTP. These files stay up forever and their names
and contents do not change.  Many big services (Bloomberg, EDGAR Online, Google, etc.)
grind through that data every day.  One of my systems, <a href="http://www.downside.com/" title="downside.com">Downside</a> [downside.com], does it too.  There's no charge for access, bulk downloads are supported, and the raw filings are accessible. That's the way it should work.
</p><p>
What you don't want is something you can only access through a search engine, with some of the information on a pay site.  A bad example is Delaware's corporate record system.

So the minimum standards for a public records system that replaces publication should be comparable to those maintained by EDGAR.</p></htmltext>

The agency I work for (which is not large), spends OVER $250,000 a year complying with these requirements.
This is money that ultimately comes out of our pockets, and into the albeit swindling coffers of the newspaper industry.I bet Craigslist would be thrilled to offer free "legals", and they can be physically posted at the city halls, libraries etc., and added to the .gov websites, and indexed by the Google.Its all about the money.
Shut the lights out will you... its over.</sentencetext>
