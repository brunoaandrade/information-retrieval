	<htmltext>I think racing an electric vehicle is the best way to advance the development of them.  <br>
Most of the automotive innovation in safety and performance we have today was developed from racing.  <br> <br>
In racing, they need to figure out how to get the most range from a battery, how to recharge/replace the battery very quickly, and how to get the sweet spot of power/efficiency to be able to hang with gas race cars.  <br> <br>
All of these are very real world problems.  Most of us don't need a 4 second battery change, but 5 minutes would be pretty sweet, comparable to refuel.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>What interests me is how they'll power the car in a 24-hour race.  There don't seem to be details on that.  <br> <br>

According to their site, there's a large solar-powered charging station (100 square meters of photovoltaic surface) which can be used to charge the car between races, but unless they're seriously loading the thing with batteries, they're either going to need long pit stops for charging or the ability to swap out battery packs as fast as other cars can pit for fuel. <br> <br>

On the other hand, with their target date two years out and the rapidly evolving electric car scene, I wouldn't be surprised if there was some hot new prototype hitting the car show circuit around then that blew their doors off.</htmltext>

<sentencetext>1) They are way underpowered, even compared to the 2008 front runners.
2) There currently is NO electric car class at all
3) LeMans is by "Invitation only", not just anyone can show up and race.
~2008 specs for the front runners:

Audi R10: 650 hp-1100 Nm-925 kg
Peugeot 908: 700 hp-1200 Nm-925 kg</sentencetext>

	<htmltext>As far as the motors making 350 - 400 hp, it's totally plausable. If you're simply doing a unit conversion from kW to HP you're doing it wrong

Hhe HP rating you're getting from that conversion is electrical horsepower, not mechanical.

You have to put this thing on a dyno to get the true output in mechanical horsepower. it's not as simple as doing a mathematical conversion from one unit to the other.

And as far as they aerodynamics, I'm sure that they designed it to be as aerodynamic as possible. Yes the tires do need cooled down, any race in that car for any amount of time would create vast amounts of heat on the tires causing them to run slower than they could with cooler tires. I'm not going to explain why that is. if you want to know look it up.

OVERALL I'm not impressed. The Tesla Roadster is faster, and more available. SOOOOOO.... I don't see any need for these guys to toss around words like 'Les Mans' because that's just not in THIS car's future. maybe something based on this. but not THIS car.</htmltext>

We do NOT have an electrical grid that can support all the new electric cars you would love to see. Sorry, its just not there, and not likely to be there for several decades.

This is a correct statement and IMO the best argument for investing in distributed solar (rooftop panels) I have ever seen.  I know it will not pay back for a number of years but it does pay back for most locations in the US.  There are even companies that will let you lease their solar cell panels on your roof in return for a long-term commitment.   There are also juicy Federal (US) subsidies on the horizon.

Somehow or other I think this will happen for ordinary folks.  And as a longtime geek, the thought of an all-electric Le Mans strikes me as a good thing, there should be some sort of relationship between the race cars for a race like that and the cars that ordinary people drive.  Maybe if they let Danica Patrick drive (she placed third at Indy this year) an electric car could win IF the rules gave them a chance.


For racing of course you don't worry about the long term, just get your car across the line first.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>There's a lot of braking in those on-street races.  I wonder if they're putting in technologies from hybrids like regenerative braking, possibly some sort of system to capture some of the energy lost on tight turns, etc... and recharging the battery for fewer stops.

If an electric wins the Le Mans, or even has a pretty good showing, the whole industry will start to re-gear overnight.  When Joe Six-Pack says, "Gas-only sucks!  I want the kind of hybrid technology that'll make me feel like a winner!!", it'll represent a sea change.

	<htmltext>You're a moron.  Torque is only a useful measurement if you fix all of the other variables.  Horsepower is always a useful measurement.<br>
<br>
Example:  I can make an cheap Chinese corless drill make 1000 ft-lbs of torque simply by adding a reducing gear.  1000 ft-lbs of torque is only really meaningful if I first give the rpm at which that torque needs to be made.  On the other hand, that Chinese drill is never going to make 1HP.  Think of HP as the ability to create torque.<br>

	<htmltext>Serious answer - I've had a long-time scheme to build an electric go-kart track using basically this idea (stationary power supply, with pickups to get the power to the karts). I was more imagining a high ceiling with a bumper-car style electrified mesh on it, though. For full sized track racing it doesn't make much sense but for an indoor kart track it's a perfect fit. You can dial your karts' speed settings individually for the drivers (hence don't need to have more than 2 different ranks of kart, rather than the 3-4 that most places have), you don't need to worry about ventilation so much, no ongoing fuel costs, no expensive engine maintenance, easy remote activation of 'limp home' mode for yellow flags.
<br> <br>Damn, I should get onto that sometime.</htmltext>
