	<title>Using WiMAX To Replace a Phone?</title>

	<htmltext>Yes, but it need not be e911 which is what would be needed to enable the location of a mobile device. Of course I don't think e911 works all that well at all. The other day I called 911 because some idiot was towing a car at very slow speed without warning lights at midnight, I spent several minutes explaining where I was and where I last saw the offending vehicle despite having a brand new Blackberry with e911 capabilities. I was talking to the highway patrol dispatcher which you would assume would be the first group to get e911 capabilities.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>I like this idea, but I am more enamored by the idea of a Wimax enabled phone. HTC will be offering a Wimax Android phone soon I believe. This is cool, because the it's carriers can't lock down the phone since it's OSS. A even cooler solution would be deploy your own Wimax router at home and have free Internet/Voip service miles from home. When you are out of range you could use a prepaid phone..

I do think laptop Wimax Voip solution would be good especially for outgoing calls.</htmltext>

Honestly, though, trying to replace your working and well-proven cell phone, and tryingt to use two very unstable technologies in it's place, is extremely stupid.

	<htmltext>I think an important thing to consider is the ability to forward your number.  I'm thinking of doing that in general.  If I have one number which I can forward different places, I can give that out to people who want to call me and I can have it forwarded to a prepaid cell phone, my work phone or other devices as needed at any particular time.  It makes your idea much more practical and I think it's how people will do things in the future.  It also helps enable more competition in the market for mobile phone devices.</htmltext>

<tokenext>Ok,I 'll bite .
I have eMobile 3G wireless and a small netbook .
The old one was 8.1/384 , which had issues staying connected on skype .
Specifically the outbound UDP buffer would fill up .
I suspect that 384 is plenty enough but in areas with worse signals it might get much less than that for periods of time long enough to cause issues...They recently switched to HSUPA which has now 8.1/5.8 , which is more than enough to keep skype happy ( even skype video !

<sentencetext>Ok,I'll bite.
I have eMobile 3G wireless and a small netbook.
The old one was 8.1/384, which had issues staying connected on skype.
Specifically the outbound UDP buffer would fill up.
I suspect that 384 is plenty enough but in areas with worse signals it might get much less than that for periods of time long enough to cause issues...They recently switched to HSUPA which has now 8.1/5.8, which is more than enough to keep skype happy (even skype video!

	<htmltext>Why don't you see phones that only support the 3G protocols?
<p>
Because they're not ubiquitous.  You will end up somewhere where coverage isn't so great for your new protocol.  If you can handoff to an older protocol, you will keep your connection.  So this is why even a few years ago you could get Verizon phones that still supported AMPS, why every phone that supports EV-DO also supports 1X (and older standards), and why every phone with WCDMA/HSDPA/HSUPA/etc still supports plain old GSM/GPRS/EDGE.
</p><p>
It's also why it doesn't make a lot of sense to have a WiMAX only phone.  You need at least WiMAX+GSM, or WiMAX+CDMA1X.  You need to be able to hand off to the older interfaces.  And probably you want to support everything... WiMAX when it's available, HSDPA or WCDMA when that's available but WiMAX isn't, or GSM/GPRS/EDGE when that's all that's available.
</p><p>
Or maybe you never leave downtown Atlanta.  Then maybe WiMAX-only would be fine, assuming you trust the reliability of the relatively new network.</p></htmltext>

	<htmltext>Another way to view this fundamental  wrong-tool-for-the-job issue is in considering the information rate you need to support for a phone call, by comparing a 2-way audio channel at ~10 kbps with a 3G data channel at whatever you call 3G but lots more than 10 kbps.
  This "3G overhead" in both up and downlink directions requires a better radio path than for the same audio call, everything else equal. Less energy needs to be transmitted for the audio call. While protocols can play games with this fundamental fact (as does EVDO by forking over the *entire* base station carrier to one user at a time and time-slicing (oversubscribing)) the fundamental service, there's no free lunch. Your limited battery and antenna size limit the range at which you can communicate with a given hot-spot/cell-site and requires that there be higher site density to serve a given user base.

This means that a WiMax solution will fundamentally be more expensive than an old voice-only solution. In the end (whenever it all catches up with the user) this will be more expensive. Simultaneous higher data rates to all users (3G) takes more capacity/coverage than 2G. You can borrow coverage from capacity and vice-versa but someone has to pay and in the WiMax case payment will probably be initially in the form of reduced coverage area and more expensive plans. If it hasn't already hit the wall as in the case of 3G (notice how US coverage is only a few percent of the geography compared to 2G?) it will definitely do so with 4G. WiMax can throttle down to something around 1 Mbps but not a lot lower. There's 100:1 (20 dB) difference in energy delivery requirements between these two rates. This fundamental system cost is going to keep it from being an effective replacement for audio-only communications.

	<htmltext>It seems like the arguments against this can be put in 3 categories.  911, battery life and coverage.
<br> <br>
I would think that if you are viewing this as a "cell"phone replacement then it would obviously fail on all 3.
<br> <br>
I remember being able to live without a cellphone.  In fact, I miss it.  I find it very annoying that in our cellphone enamoured society my friends and relatives feel "entitled" to talk to me whenever, wherever I might be.  I don't want to talk to someone as I go through the checkout line in the grocery store.  I find it annoying to try to understand someone who will not speak up when I am driving my Jeep. It's loud in there. Let alone the safety issues!  I'd rather call people back when it's convenient for me.  Just like I would have with an answering machine and a landline about 12 years ago.  Does this make me old?  I am only 29.
<br> <br>
That in mind I too have considered what the author is asking though I would use a more portable form, some sort of PDA rather than a netbook.
<br> <br>
I would keep separate power adapters in my office at work, one at home and a third in my car.  Most of the time I would be in one of those places and could plug it in.  Don't want to be tethered to the plug?  Use bluetooth! If I don't get a signal in my car then oh-well.  I know how to change a tire! That about takes care of the power problem. It just doesn't have to be on every moment I am not in one of those places.  If I need to make a call, that's when I would turn it on and use the battery.
<br> <br>
As for coverage... wifi at home and work are easy.  Your mileage will vary at work but I doubt many on this site don't have it at home. Anywhere else it works... that's just a bonus.
<br> <br>
Think you have too much of a social life to not be always connected?  Do you think you will miss too much because you're out?  I think not... you are on Slashdot!  Seriously though, I was a college student with one of the busiest lives I knew just before I got my first cellphone.  Missing calls didn't stop me, if I missed it then I was already busy!  If I missed too many calls then maybe I would have ended up at home, but then I wouldn't miss the next call.  See how that works?!
<br> <br>
Now, 911.  This issue has been brought up against every form of VoIP since the begining.  I have to ask... does it really matter that much?  Honestly, I don't know the answer to this but don't the 911 operators have the ability to transfer to one another quickly?  If not then this is a problem the public should be crying to see addressed!  What if a call was coming in via radio or some other third party method where the person making the call is not in the same local as the emergency.  Hasn't there always been a need for 911 calls to be transfered?</htmltext>

The only downsides were obvious: a) It's still a very bulky phone. b) You look a right dork talking to your computer in a coffee shop, unless you have a headset, and even then, it's fairly unsociable. I suppose the solution is to carry a Skype handset with you at all times too! c) Here in the UK you can buy from 3 (network) a mobile/cell phone with built in WiFi and use that.

Now, this is where it gets interesting! The Nokia E71 plus Fring was excellent using the included free data allowance thought Vodafone. The call quality was BETTER across Fring and Vodafone's data than making a conventional voice call. The only downsides to all this was as someone else has mentioned, the battery life is massively reduced because your phone and data connection has to be 'on' all the time. However, with wearable solar panels, one day, this problem will be dealt with. We're just a few years away from making mobile always on VOiP a reality.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>Clear's VOIP service does offer Enhanced 911.

Now, using 3rd party voice over a WiMAX connection? Not reliable. My connection, two blocks from one tower (suburbs of Portland, OR), and a quarter-mile from another, nosedives randomly at night. No connection = no Officer Friendly or Fire Marshal Bill when needed.

I still pay for a landline just for 911 reliability
  (and, monitor my landline regularly to make sure the local telco, Qworst, formerly known as US Worst, does not put a 'pair gain' box on it to let then share the copper pair with a neighbor so they can deliver two dial tones over one copper pair - that takes batteries, and batteries fail).

I also keep a two-way radio in the house, with the instructions for 911 access through the local repeater on a plastic tag.

The universe is not friendly, and enough humans are also not friendly, for me to consider artful paranoia as a potentially life-saving interesting hobby.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>I thought the same thing when I saw that my PPC phone supported wifi.  However, the battery on the phone has a very limited life when I have both wifi and bluetooth running.  I'm lucky if I can get half an hour out of a fully charged battery.

Also, the problem with non-EVDO wireless ISP's is that they are really designed for fixed wireless, not roaming.  If you think you see to many dead zones with your cell phone, wait until you try WiMax.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>When I first moved out of my hometown to another city after graduating, my first concern was staying in touch with friends and family without using my phone to save on long distance calls. I also wanted them to be able to call me without extra costs. So here's what I did.

Using my laptop I was able to get a full "voip" line using Skype with the Skype-Out service and getting a phone number through DID Worldwide.

Skype-Out costs around 3$ a month and the DID number costs 5$ a month. This way for approx. 7$ I was able to make and receive calls through Skype.

To go a step further, you could get a Skype Phone so you won't have to carry around a netbook or a laptop.</htmltext>

Mine has a battery life similar to that of my cell phone.

	<title>WiMAX was designed for this, implementations lag</title>

	<htmltext><p>WiMAX was designed to handle VoIP traffic, and has specific traffic categories on the airlink for isochronous flows, like RTP and other VoIP payload streams.  Unlike something like Ethernet, which is CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access, with collision detection), traffic is scheduled by the carrier network.  For uplink data, your WiMAX card goes through a process of requesting bandwidth on what amounts to a hailing channel, and then gets a bandwidth allocation it can use.  In theory, a small but constant amount of bandwidth can be allocated for VoIP at the airlink level, resulting in low jitter, low latency, and low frame loss.
</p><p>
There are a couple of problems with this.
</p><p>
The first problem is that not all WiMAX cards on the market today (in fact, quite possibly none of them) have sufficient sophistication in their device drivers and microcontrollers to send the RTP (or Skype, or whatever VoIP protocol you're using) packets on an isochronous service flow while the balance of the packets travel on a general-purpose service flow.  As a result, the RTP (etc) packets have to compete with whatever else your machine is doing, either stuff you're initiating with the browser, or background things like checking email or updating the Vista weather widget, or checking for updates of one kind or another.  It doesn't help matters that no operating system has a network stack that implements the service flow concept.
</p><p>
The second problem is that low-speed isochronous flows over the WiMAX OFDMA airlink depend upon sharing a fairly large timeslot with other users transmitting simultaneously on the uplink using a different set of carriers, at least if the system is going to be economically feasible for the carrier.  Allocating an entire timeslot often enough to keep the delay below half a second or so would result in considerable wasted bandwidth, so the idea is to have users share a timeslot by have each one use only a fraction of the available carriers.  Decoding the resulting burst at the base station then depends upon maintaining orthogonality between OFDM carriers, which means that <i>exact</i> frequency synchronization is required between multiple users.  While each user's WiMAX card synchronizes its clock with the base station, doppler shift due to changes in speed or direction or a changing multipath environment can change the received frequency at the base station enough to compromise orthogonality and make the burst impossible to decode.
</p><p>
The result of all this is, from your perspective, is that your VoIP traffic could be jittery and have long delays and high packet loss, especially when the carrier's network is heavily loaded.</p></htmltext>

<sentencetext>I've always theorized that there's nothing like a good, old-fashioned PHONE.
I've known people want to get rid of their phone lines because "I'll just use Skype and the neighbor's wi-fi".One word here: reliability.
I don't want my phone line to be reliant on either [1] the electrical main working at my home, or [2] my computer being powered on and working.Back in my landline-only days, I always had a cordless and corded phone, so I could make and receive calls during a power failure.
Now that I'm cell-only, the problem is taken care of, as long as I keep my phone charged.
"Honey, call 911!
The neighbor's house in on fire!
""I can't!
I've been mooching their wi-fi and the fire already destroyed their WAP, so I can't Skype!

	<htmltext>I'm surprised I'm seeing not a lot of comments here about latency issues.  I live in Baltimore and I also happen to live in an area where we're stuck with a single provider for broadband internet (a condo with an exclusive contract to a horrible, horrible ISP.  No, not Comcast or Verizon... MDU Communications).  Before WiMAX came along, I had no option but to stick with the horrible ISP or deal with dial up.  When I found out WiMAX was available where I live, I was excited.  I went to one of their booths at a mall and played with it, but I was a little concerned with the latency.  I was pinging google and wasn't getting a response for ~250ms.  This isn't horrible for such a service, but even MDU gives me less than half that for most sites.

You might want to stop by a WiMAX booth in a mall like I did and try and make a few calls and make sure everything works as expected.  They let me do pretty much whatever I wanted (in fact, the sales guy pretty much left me alone).</htmltext>
