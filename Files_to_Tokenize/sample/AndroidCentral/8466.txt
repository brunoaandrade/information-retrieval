 Huh? It looks like we, the United States of America, will be able to feel the 'bump' of the Motoroi too? Um, huh? Just yesterday, we had reported that the Motorola Motoroi would be the first Motorola Android device in South Korea and we fully expected it to stay in the Far East like other Motorola Android devices. But it looks like we were wrong. Hooray?According a SK Telecom Exec:&quot;The Motoroi is a different model from the Droid, and it will be launched in the United States around March,&quot; Bae Joon-dong, senior vice president of SK Telecom, said at a press conference.And a Motorola Exec:&quot;The product will be launched in other markets around the world,&quot; Rick Wolochatiuk, president and representative director of Motorola Korea, said.On one hand, the Motoroi packs some really impressive specs (8mp camera, 720p video recording, HDMI out). But on the other, it's kind of ugly and certainly not the most ideal Droid successor (in terms of style). We have some faith though, the China-only Motorola Android devices we saw at CES we're of really high build quality and we walked away really impressed. Maybe we'll fall in love with the bump like we did the chin?[korea herald via gizmodo] </text>

	<text>I don't see anything wrong with the looks. Actually you can tell they pretty much copied the iphone. I like the looks of this compared to my droid hands down, although I would never give my droid up for anything right now.</text>

	<text>So does that mean every touch screen smart phone copied the iphone? The flat, square design is popular because it is logical. What other shape could it be and still fit comfortably in the hand? Most of Apples' designs are just common sense and would have been introduced sooner or later, Apple is just the fastest to market most of the time. You can applaud them for speed to market, but the designs are hardly anything earth shattering.</text>

	<text>No not every phone copied the iPhone. But it is pretty obvious they did borrow some of the looks for this phone. I mean look, same shape minus the bump. Also the chrome bezel around the phone. Never said it was a bad thing. Companies copy other companies all the time. Look at the auto industry. You can't tell me a lot of cars look very similar. Its how they compete. Never said it was a bad thong or complained at all about it.</text>

	<text>I think the bump will be great if that is where the shutter button is for the camera.  It's easier to find in the dark and 8mp camera will make this thing worth replacing any camera you might carry. I don't mind the bump at all.</text>
