From the Forums is a great way for you, our readers, to see the hottest topics being discussed. But you must be a registered member and becoming a member is a simple process. So if you have not already already done so, head on over and register now!

While Motorola Droid owners patiently wait for Android 2.1 it seems some of them are also getting a small maintenance update, have you gotten yours?
 If you are looking to get an Android device, get ready to make some tough decision -- Moto Droid or Nexus One? First and foremost always remember to first take into consideration which carrier gives you better service.
We've been hearing so much lately regarding Android 2.1, so why not discuss whether or not the Sprint HTC Hero will get the update or not.
Facebook for Android has been working a bit better lately, at least for those of us here at Android Central. How has Facebook been working for you?
The Smartphone Experts Round Robin continues and this week Phil from WMExperts (and of course here) needs your help! Help him out for your chance to win a new device!

See you on the forums! </text>

	<text>I thought the Eris had the 2.0 update? That they both had the newest firmware. I think thats the one fault about Android is that there are so many phones running on different firmwares, I think they should all be the same. Hopefully they will get on that!!</text>

	<text>Still no OTA.  Should there be an icon or something to prompt me?  I updated to 2.0 on my own so I am not sure if I am missing something.</text>
