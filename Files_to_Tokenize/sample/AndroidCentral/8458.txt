 Looking good always come with a price. The Motorola Droid just got its good ol' fashioned iSuppli bill of materials list and the total came out to $179.11 per device. Which is ever so slightly more expensive than the $174.15 bill of materials for the Nexus One. A little bit surprising right?There's a good amount of pricy hardware in the Droid, for example the amazing screen costs $17.75 by itself, but making it a capacitive touchscreen adds another $17.50. It's always kind of cool to see what the bill of materials is for a device but we have to say, there has to be a better deal available than the $14.25 Camera Module, since the pictures the Droid takes just aren't that good.[isuppli] </text>

	<text>is it really fair to reference a link about the Droid camera from Nov 9th?  Wasn't that during the period of time where the droid camera auto focus was borked?</text>

	<text>The only reason the Droid is more expensive is because of that 16gb sd card.</text>

	<text>Can anyone say MASSIVE profit?  The phone costs $299.99 at a 2 year price, it's $199.99 with a new line of service and $529.99 without a contract. That's a $112.24,  $12.24 and $342.24 respectively. </text>

	<text>But you also forgot to include costs like development, marketing, etc etc.  There's more costs to produce the phone then the materials itself.</text>
