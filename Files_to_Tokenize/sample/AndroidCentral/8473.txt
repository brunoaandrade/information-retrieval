 So here's some video of the Motorola Motoroi (aka the Sholes Tablet) in its Korean form. It should give you a decent idea of what we believe is coming to the United States at some point. Oh, and see that pinch-and-zoom action going on there? Don't get too used to that. Video after the break. (Thanks to everyone who sent this in.)

	<text>That looks pretty laggy, but actually, that website, shown in the demo video has full of pictures and flashes (although not fully supported as of now) so even on Droid, moving around in that page is pretty laggy.  On top of that, the page was still loading, see?</text>

	<text>I was thinking the same thing. I guarantee it was because the page was still loading. </text>
