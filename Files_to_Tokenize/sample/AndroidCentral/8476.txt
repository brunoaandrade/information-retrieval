Need more proof that the long-rumored HTC myTouch Slide (aka the myTouch 2 and Espresso) is on the way? This may be it. The user-agent string (which is what identifies browsers to the Web sites on which they're calling) is live at HTC. It clearly shows a 320x480 screen (same size as the myTouch 3G) along with a QWERTY keyboard. Still looking at a possible launch in May. It's also being called a possible follow to the HTC Magic, which is still in the same ballpark. We'll have to see, of course, as nothing's been announced.HTC via Unwired View </text>

	<text>That's not a user-agent string (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) but a user-agent profile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAProf), two different things.</text>
