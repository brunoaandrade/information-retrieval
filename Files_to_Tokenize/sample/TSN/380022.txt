	<text>Ryder with a great opportunity in Dallas, Sabres goaltending and a look at the top free agent signings of the off-season.Today's Hodgemail question is which players were the best free agent signings of the off-season. Using my NHL Player Rankings, and not including players that re-signed with their old teams, here are my leading contenders among players that have seen action in at least half a dozen games:&nbsp;RANKPLAYERTEAMPOS.RATING1.Brian&nbsp;ElliottGSt. Louis93.542.Sheldon&nbsp;SourayDDallas90.523.Jaromir&nbsp;JagrRWPhiladelphia81.214.Mike&nbsp;SmithGPhoenix79.525.Michael&nbsp;RyderRWDallas77.696.Tomas&nbsp;FleischmannLWFlorida77.067.Jose&nbsp;TheodoreGFlorida76.848.Corey&nbsp;PotterDEdmonton76.629.Aaron&nbsp;JohnsonDColumbus76.5810.Kent&nbsp;HuskinsDSt. Louis75.8811.Ian&nbsp;WhiteDDetroit75.8112.James&nbsp;WisniewskiDColumbus74.8913.Brad&nbsp;RichardsCN.Y.

Islanders66.2230.Tim&nbsp;ConnollyCToronto66.11The usual caveats about small sample size have to apply when looking at the first 10-15 games of a season, but it's fascinating to see how many guys that would be considered after-thoughts that rank among the leaders early in this season.Guys likeBrian&nbsp;Elliott,Aaron&nbsp;Johnson,Corey&nbsp;Potter,Kent&nbsp;Huskinsare in the Top 10, ahead of more highly-touted -- and highly-paid -- performers likeBrad&nbsp;RichardsandChristian&nbsp;Ehrhoff, to say nothing of, say,Ville&nbsp;Leino.Obviously, this doesn't mean that Elliott, Potter et al are more valuable and should have landed the monster contracts, it's simply a reflection on which players have performed well through the first month of the season.On to notes from Tuesday...STAR BRIGHTOne of the top free-agent signings of the off-season, Stars RWMichael&nbsp;Ryder, has been living large since getting a shot on the number one line withJamie&nbsp;BennandLoui&nbsp;ErikssonwhileSteve&nbsp;Ottis injured.Ryder has seven points and is plus-6 in the last three games, giving him 11 points and a plus-9 rating in 14 games. In the last six seasons, Ryder has finished better than plus-3 once (plus-28 with Boston in 2008-2009), but if he manages to stay with Benn and Eriksson, the 31-year-old might also be in line for 20 goals and 50 points for the first time since 2008-2009 as well.He's still not playing as much as he did last season, but Benn has been ripping it up, scoring in nine of the Stars' last ten games, putting up 16 points in that stretch. As a left-winger who is scoring a point per game and (for fantasy owners) has more than a penalty minute per game, Benn's production is rare and, since he's just 22, it may keep getting better.While it's all well and good to see the Stars' stars producing, part of their early-season success is also due to the play ofEric&nbsp;Nystrom, the left winger that couldn't crack the Minnesota Wild lineup coming out of camp. Well, Nystrom has scored four goals in the last five games -- on seven shots -- helping the Wild to their current five-game winning streak.Keep in mind, however, that Nystrom is playing 11:27 per game and doesn't generate enough offence for this to continue. Regression will come but, in the meantime, Nystrom can take comfort knowing that he already has as many goals as he scored in 82 games last season.MILLER TIME? NOT SO FASTSabres GRyan&nbsp;Millerwas ultimately victorious Tuesday against Winnipeg, but Miller has now surrendered 15 goals in his last four starts, posing a 4.76 goals against average and .851 save percentage, which stands in stark contrast to the work of backupJhonas&nbsp;Enroth, who has a 1.41 goals against average and .952 save percentage in five appearances.Yes, these are small sample sizes and Miller isn't in danger of losing the starting job, but as long as Miller struggles, there will be more opportunities for Enroth to make inroads and gain more playing time.Sabres rookie RWCorey&nbsp;Troppscored his first NHL goal Tuesday against Winnipeg, in his third NHL game. The former Michigan State Spartan had 47 points and 129 penalty minutes in 86 AHL games before getting promoted whenPatrick&nbsp;Kaletawas suspended. While he did score 20 goals and 42 points in 37 games in his last year at Michigan State, Tropp is more of an energy forward at this stage of his development, playing eight minutes per game with the Sabres.OIL NEWSRWAles&nbsp;Hemskyreturned to the Edmonton lineup Tuesday, playing withShawn&nbsp;HorcoffandRyan&nbsp;Smython a veteran line, whileMagnus&nbsp;Paajarvitook a seat in the press box. Paajarvi has one assist in 13 games this season, not exactly building on his 34-point rookie campaign.Hall-Eberle-RNH ice time was down against Montreal, with all three playing fewer than 15 minutes. Hall played a season-low 14:05, didn't register a shot on goal and now has zero points and a minus-2 rating in five games on the road this season. Matchups are often the name of the game, especially on the road, and right now Hall's road woes stand in contract to his rookie season (when he had 23 points in 30 road games and 19 points in 35 home games).DEVIL MAY CARENew Jersey C/RWDainius&nbsp;Zubrusnow has six points in the last seven games, after coming up with nothing in the first six games of the year, and played 23:19 on Tuesday against Carolina, his most ice time in a game since January 1, 2007.FRANZEN FINDS THE MARKAfter scoring four goals and seven points in 11 games to start the season, Red Wings RWJohan&nbsp;Franzenhas four goals and six points in the last two games. He's the only Red Wing ahead of D Nicklas Listrom (who has six) in goal-scoring.BLUE NOTESA few observations from the Blues' first game under Ken Hitchcock:Jaroslav&nbsp;Halakgot the shutout win, with a season-high 29 saves.21-year-old rookie LWEvgeny&nbsp;Grachevplayed 7:09, his second-lowest time on ice in a game this season, after playing a season-high 12:43 in the Blues' loss to Minnesota on Saturday.T.J.&nbsp;Oshiecontinued his hot streak and now has eight points in his last eight games.BACK IN THE CAGEMinnesota GNiklas&nbsp;Backstrommade 41 saves in a shutout win at Calgary, the second time this season that Backstrom has made 41 saves in a game and a strong return for his first start since October 27. In the meantime,Josh&nbsp;Hardinghas been exceptional, allowing three goals against in four starts.WAKING UP?Kings LWDustin&nbsp;Penner, who had one assist in the first 12 games, recorded two assists in Los Angeles' win over Nashville Tuesday. He still hasn't scored, but is playing withMike&nbsp;RichardsandDustin&nbsp;Brown, which should give him a chance.Scott Cullen can be reached atScott.Cullen@bellmedia.ca&nbsp;and followed on Twitter athttp://twitter.com/tsnscottcullen.

	<text>It floors me that the rest of the league and its fans and its beat writers are really surprised over Ville Leino"s current performance. His stint in Philly was a fluke, as any Red Wings fan will tell you like Toronto giving Brett Lebda that monstrous contract, we laughed.  Heartily. Now that he"s back down to earth, people are shocked that he"s playing like the player who landed in Babcock"s doghouse and got traded for a bag of pucks to Philly?!

Kind of like Martin Lapointe being offered that monster contract by Boston after having a single career contract year in Detroit. Then-Bruins GM Mike O"Connell made the mistake of assuming Marty Lapointe was going to be a career 20+ goal scorer when all of Red Wings land knew he was a grinding crasher-banger, not an elite goal scorer.</text>

	<text>@crimson667 Agreed with most of your post, but the Boston/Lapointe contract had less to do with Marty"s production and more to do with Jacobs sticking it to Illitch.</text>

	<text>It would have been nice to have Ryder with the B"s but the cap hit for the years he wanted wasn"t going to fit in with the $"s needed for Rask and Krejci next year and beyond, Lucic, Marchand and Seguin in 2013 and beyond. The B"s still have to sign Hamilton, who"ll more than likely make their roster for the 2012-2013 season. Cap relief could come from Caron sticking, Sauve and Knight making the B"s next season, pushing out a 3rd and 4th line forward. A trade is possible for a high draft pick, as well. Good problems to have for the B"s!</text>
