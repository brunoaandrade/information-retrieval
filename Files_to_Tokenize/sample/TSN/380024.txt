	<text>The Vancouver Canucks had a familiar face on the ice Wednesday, as wingerMason&nbsp;Raymondpracticed with teammates for the first time since suffering a broken vertebra in Game 6 of last year's Stanley Cup Final.Raymond has been on skates for about three weeks, working with skills coach Glenn Carnegie, but Wednesday marked another hurdle in the 26-year-old's rehabilitation.&quot;One thing is a practice and a game is another thing,&quot; Raymond told The Vancouver Province following practice. &quot;I can't put a timeline on when I feel I can come back and frankly I feel like I've got a long ways to go. To get into game shape, to get in to mental shape and being cleared for contact, I've got a lot of hurdles to clear. But as far as Day 1 goes, I was pleased.&quot;Raymond hasn't played a game since suffering the injury when he was run into the boards by Boston Bruins defencemanJohnny&nbsp;Boychuk.While he expects to get back to where he was before the injury, he said there's no timeline on his return.&quot;Right from the start you believe you're going to get back,&quot; Raymond told The Province. &quot;I continue to progress. Am I 100 per cent? No, but you think back to situations where you realize how lucky you are to play this game.&quot;For me, that incident makes me realize how lucky you are to have the use of your arms, your legs, the gift that we have to play this as a living. I still have quite a few hurdles to cross. Will I get back to 100 per cent? I don't know yet, but I'm continuing to feel better all the time so it's a big step in the right direction.&quot;While physical hurdles stand in front of Raymond, he says the mental ones pose a challenge as well.&quot;I still think I need to go through a lot of that, to tell you the truth,&quot; he said. &quot;It's tough. I had a serious, serious injury. I'm taking the right steps and so far so good. There's a lot of mental work with injuries. You continue to learn from it but this is a step where I'm happy to be and I know there's much more to go.&quot;The Canucks open a two-game road trip beginning in Los Angeles on Thursday and concluding Friday in Anaheim.</text>

	<text>Strange that Boychuck is still playing hockey isn"t it?  Oh ya I forgot Campbell"s daddy was in charge of discipline at the time Raymond has hurt...not Shanny.  Regardless I hope that Mason is able to make a full recovery and get back to playing his speed game.</text>

	<text>I like Raymond always have, but I don"t see where he fits into the future of the Canucks lineup. Hodgson is making a smooth transition to a winger and has great vision out there. Although he is outmatched by Raymonds speed, his vision is in another class. With Raymond being in the last year of his contract I wouldn"t be surprised that he comes back plays a few games to showcase, but the end product could be him shipped off for a pick or a depth player. I wish him the best of luck with the rest of his recovery and hopefully he can play the rest of his career avoiding a serious injury like this one.</text>

	<text>It was an awful accident and I"m glad to see him back on his skates. dpaq22: I think you make a really good point. Burrows/Raymond was the reason Grabner became expendable and I think you"re right that the Canucks may have better options at winger next year. Raymond is speedy, but that"s really his only exceptional trait which is kind of limiting. Hopefully he can come back healthy and prove his worth, whether he ends up staying with the Canucks or moving on to a new team. Get well soon, Mason!</text>

	<text>I still can"t believe Boston fans booing and calling it a dive when Mason Raymond didn"t get up on his own. On the other side of the coin, I can"t believe they didn"t insist on the body-board to remove Raymond from the ice. He"s lucky to be walking today. All in all though, I"m hoping for the best for Raymond, and that he finds the right spot for himself in a rather full line-up.</text>

	<text>Raymond was injured in the series that won Boston a cup and ended Colin Campbells career as corrupt NHL big wig. His decisions that entire season and playoff run was so blatantly obviously one sided towards Boston it makes me cringe..  Chara, Lucic both should have been suspended in the season, Horton spraying water in a fans face, the scoring the series winnder the next game vs. Tampa, onwards to the Boston favoured decisions he made in the Final series, its pretty obvious that he was making personal decisions and the league quickly and quietly brought in Shanny before facing further embarassment.</text>

	<text>Romes hit on horton, a late hit but a north-south hit with Horton not paying attention..warrants the rest of the finals suspension.  Mason Raymond, tangled, Boychuk did not let up and ran him into the boards... intent or no intent, mason raymond had a broken back and was out for the finals.... the same logic of punishment should have been applied to boychuk...conspiracy or not... the inconsistency in the punishment department last post-season/season was abysmal.</text>

	<text>Good to see you back, Mason from a non-Canuck fan.  I had a similar injury...it really doesn"t require alot of force and the pain is excrutiating, but the fact that you are skating this quickly shows what a competitor you are. Good luck with your season and I hope you are back in the line-up soon.</text>

	<text>Hope to see Raymond back 100% healthy with the Nucks, practice is a good start. As for everyone wondering why Colin Campbell didn"t suspend Boychuck, Campbell had already stepped aside before the finals started, while I figured at least an interference penalty would have been called, this whole ordeal has nothing to do with Campbell....hate sticking up for the guy but its the truth lol. Mike Murphy took over with the assistance of various GMs Burke around the league....</text>

	<text>I"m not a Nuks fan at all but when I seen what happened to Raymond I was disgusted. there was nothing called on that.. Yet the Rome hit warrants a suspension when it was borderline interference. Horton took one stride as Rome leveled him after he threw the puck away. You see this all the time when players ring the puck around the boards or shoot the puck out/into the zone it doesn"t even merit a penalty</text>

	<text>We don"t need to rekindle the finals. With or without Raymond Boston was better and deserved to win. No one can dispute that. That being said Boychuk drove Raymond into the boards in a freakishly vulnerable position. Did he mean to break his back? I don"t think so but he meant to put him in the boards without the puck knowing what sort of position he was in. The lamest excuse you hear is it was a "hockey play". Give me a break! I guess if a "hockey play" is a guy hitting another guy without the puck in a vulnerable position. No different than a hit from behind and from the result obviously just as dangerous.</text>

	<text>Boot88: Mason Raymond"s injury was a minor contributing factor. The loss of Hamhuis, Samuelsson,and Rome, and the injuries to Kesler and Edler had a greater effect on the outcome. Like Manny Malhotra, Savard was a non-starter in the Playoffs and Nathan Horton got into 21 games. If you look at man-games lost among the starers for both teams, Vancouver lost 39 games and Boston lost only 7.</text>

	<text>No one wants to hear lame excuses as to why the Canucks didn"t win the SCF last year. Saying that Colin Campbell has anythign to do with it is the lamest of those excuses. Anyone who knows hockey will tell you that Mason"s injury was just an awkward hockey play. Great to see him back though! Go Canucks!</text>

Its not like its a sidney crosby story that hockey needs mason raymond, which is a crock with whoever"s name you attach to it. But the fact is this man has recovered from a serious injury, and the dedication and tough rehabilitation he as endured just to get another chance at the NHL speaks volumes..and to any other player who did the same, none more impressive than Mr. Gary Roberts...TWICE</text>

	<text>infowars, there was no suspension because of one thing, the officials, the media and even the CBC broadcasters claimed it was "incidental" and "accidental" actions by Boychuk and it was "unfortunate" that Raymond got hurt. They all failed to miss Boychuk using the can opener to put Raymond in the vulnerable position and someone also missed Boychuk driving Raymond from the face off dot into the boards. But of course I am just a whining Canuck fan. Aside from the sarcasm, that is exactly how it was called, accidental and incidental, not intentional. Thats how it was called in the Finals, because after all every Canuck dives everytime so how could a Bruin actually commit a penalty?</text>

The year he resigned was the year he paid for his son or whatever to win the cup.  Why wasn"t the hit on Raymond suspendable?  A player in a vulnerable position.

@bchydro, campbell stepped down before the finals.
@grousegrind... the canucks built a reputation of diving throughout the playoffs. i know every team has their divers, but they really set a new standard. you can"t keep crying wolf and then get mad when nobody cares. please don"t bring up class.... we saw enough of it after game 7.

perhaps bruins fans would be crying about burrows not being suspended for biting bergeron and scoring the gwg in the following game... but excuses are for the team that loses.</text>

I wish him all the best in his comeback, that was a devastating injury, I hope he can play again like he always has.  Oh, and bruins04 made some really good points, if you Vancouver fans want to read them.  Annoys the crap out of me that you guys bring up carrying yourself with class, of all people.  Try living up to your standards for everyone else, perhaps.</text>

	<text>Great to see him on his way back, no one should ever want to see that type of injury occur.  Seriously nucks fans give it up, if you think that one call or lack there of lost you the cup you live in a dream world - there is no way you get lit up in a series the way the Canucks did and can expect to win.  If you"re looking to place blame, then look at the lack of toughness both mentally and physically in that series. I definitely wouldn"t call your goalie clutch either.  Great to see Mason on his way back, best of luck to him.</text>

	<text>Pretty amazing that this kid has made such progress in such a short amount of time.  He could easily be confined to a wheel chair for the rest of his life, yet he"s worked so hard that he"ll probably be back playing hockey in the NHL less than 6 months after the injury.  Unbelievable to be honest.  I"d like to say the same about how classless some of the Bruins fans are here, but unfortunately it"s entirely too believable that they"re such poor winners.  Even the Blackhawk fans had more class as champions than the Bruins fans, and that"s saying a lot.  There are exceptions of course.  Good on ya double, for providing an example of how decent human beings cheer for their team and respect the health and well-being of their rivals.</text>

	<text>Really glad to see Raymond back on the ice. Hope he makes a total recovery.
As a Nucks fan I have no excuses for last year. I"m ashamed of the riots, the blow outs in boston, even some of the dives. No excuses. BUT.
It"s no surprise there were dives, the amount of cheap shots the other teams were firing at the nucks was retarded. Skill and speed wise not many teams could compete with the nucks, so we saw all the cheap shots.
They needed ways to compete.

Boston didn"t "WIN" the cup. Vancouver LOST it.</text>
