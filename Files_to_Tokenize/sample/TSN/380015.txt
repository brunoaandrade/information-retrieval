	<text>TORONTO -- It seems the Canadian Football Hall of Fame will have to wait a little longer for Anthony Calvillo.The Montreal Alouettes star quarterback is a can't-miss first-ballot selection into the hallowed hall when he hangs up his cleats. But Calvillo certainly didn't sound like he was pondering retirement Wednesday after earning his fourth straight East Division nomination for the CFL's outstanding player award and seventh overall.&quot;I think once you get bored or tired of winning and being nominated then it's time to quit,&quot; Calvillo said. &quot;I'm definitely not tired of it.&quot;The 39-year-old is looking to capture the CFL's top individual honour for the third time in four years and fourth overall. That would put the 18-year veteran behind only Doug Flutie (six) as the most decorated player in league history.And Calvillo is showing no signs of slowing down, leading the league in passing (5,251 yards) and finishing tied with West Division nominee Travis Lulay of the B.C. Lions for most TD passes (32). Calvillo also had just eight interceptions despite attempting a league-high 654 passes.Calvillo also re-wrote the CFL record book, becoming the all-time leader in passing yards (73,349), completions (5,444) and TD passes (418). This came following Calvillo's stunning announcement after last year's Grey Cup win he required off-season surgery to remove a cancerous lesion on his thyroid gland.Calvillo's wife, Alexia Kontolemos, successfully fought cancer two years ago.Lulay led B.C. to 10 wins over its final 11 regular-season games and top spot in the West Division. The six-foot-two, 216-pound quarterback was second to Calvillo in passing yards (4,815) and tied for most TD passes in his first full season as the Lions' starter.&quot;Part of it is I've been fortunate to remain healthy,&quot; Lulay said. &quot;I learned a lot over the course of the season.&quot;I do feel like, along with the rest of the football team, we have matured a lot as the season went on. Hopefully we will continue to grow in the playoffs.&quot;Calvillo certainly has a huge edge on Lulay in terms of experience, accomplishments and overall standing among CFL voters. Lulay's 58.7 per cent completion average was second-lowest among league starters and had more interceptions (11) than Calvillo despite 71 fewer pass attempts.But Lulay is much more mobile than Calvillo, a threat to either run or at the very least extend plays with his legs. And if his interceptions are a checkmark against him, then needing less attempts to throw 32 TD strikes than Calvillo certainly works in Lulay's favour.Calvillo could also be the victim of his own success. He's a multiple award winner whose story is very well known by members of the Football Reporters of Canada, who vote on the individual honours along with the eight CFL head coaches.Lulay, on the other hand, is a new face -- he's in his third CFL season -- and offers the refreshing story of a humble 28-year-old making the most of his chance to be a CFL starter.Lulay also had four TD passes in B.C.'s 43-1 home win over Montreal on Saturday night that earned the Lions first in the West. Calvillo finished 9-of-17 passing for 63 yards as the loss relegated the Alouettes to second in the East behind the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.&quot;It's not based on one game, it's on 18 games,&quot; Calvillo said. &quot;I take a lot of pride in trying to be consistent year in and year out and the athletes we have here on this team and this organization have allowed me and so many of the guys to achieve so much.&quot;Lulay also tipped his cap to his teammates.&quot;The quarterback can't do anything without the guys around him,&quot; he said. &quot;It really is a reflection on how the team has played in the second half of the season.&quot;The offensive line has played great. I've been fortunate to have good skill guys around me and make me look good.&quot;B.C. kicker Paul McCallum was the only unanimous selection, earning the West nomination as top special-teams player. McCallum, the CFL's oldest player at age 41, set a league record for kicking accuracy by hitting on 50-of-53 field goal attempts (94.3 per cent). He was also automatic from inside 40 yards, hitting all 39 attempts as his misses were from 45, 47 and 57 yards.McCallum also scored a CFL-high 203 points and hit a league-record 30 straight field goals.But he faces stiff competition from Chad Owens of the Toronto Argonauts, last year's winner. Owens became the first player in pro football history to register consecutive seasons of 3,000 all-purpose yards and led the CFL in punt and kickoff returns.Saskatchewan Roughriders linebacker Jerrell Freeman and Winnipeg defensive back Jovon Johnson are the outstanding defensive player nominees. Freeman had a CFL-high 105 tackles and six sacks while Johnson anchored a staunch Bombers defence with a league-best eight interceptions, returning two for touchdowns.Johnson is also the first Bomber nominated for a CFL award since 2008.Edmonton Eskimos tailback Jerome Messam, a Toronto native who grew up in Brampton, Ont., was the West Division nominee as outstanding Canadian. Messam, who was dealt by B.C. prior to the start of the season, finished third in CFL rushing with 1,057 yards (solid 5.4-yard average) and became the league's first Canadian-born 1,000-yard rusher since 2000.The six-foot-three, 246-pound Messam presents a real challenge for defences because he's a powerful inside runner yet has the quickness to turn a potentially small gain into a huge play. Messam, 26, always believed he could play in the CFL but simply needed the opportunity.&quot;This means a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;I've worked hard and it feels great to be recognized.&quot;Hopefully people like me, Andrew Harris (B.C. running back) and (Calgary tailback) Jon Cornish and receivers like Chris Getzlaf (of the Saskatchewan Roughriders) are opening doors for other guys.&quot;Getzlaf and Cornish were both West Division nominees for the award.Montreal kicker Sean Whyte got the East nomination. The Alouettes acquired Whyte from B.C. for a 2012 first-round draft pick and the Surrey, B.C., native paid immediate dividends, hitting 45-of-52 field goals (86.5 per cent) -- including a team-record 24 straight -- and finishing tied for second in CFL scoring with 197 points.Receiver Chris Williams, who had a team-high 70 catches for 1,064 yards and six touchdowns for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, earned the East Division nomination for top rookie. Linebacker J.C. Sherritt, who recorded 72 tackles and three forced fumbles for an Edmonton defence that allowed a league-low 385 points, was the West finalist.Tackles Jovan Olafioye of B.C. and Josh Bourke of Montreal are the top lineman finalists. Olafioye helped the Lions surrender a league-low 29 sacks while the Alouettes gave up just 34 sacks but are now minus Bourke, a native of Windsor, Ont., who suffered a late-season pectoral muscle injury.&quot;I feel like its a blessing being recognized individually when the offensive line is really a team effort,&quot; Oafioye said. &quot;It (29 sacks) comes from unity, being together for so long.&quot;Last year we had a lot of different positions everybody was playing. Just being together makes everybody feel more comfortable. Everyone is thinking the same.&quot;-- With files from Jim Morris in Vancouver and Heather Engel in Montreal.</text>

	<text>I think last weeks game between the Lions and Als showed who was more outstanding.  Lulay by a country mile.  And....what"s with Messam as outstanding Canadian?  Sure, he had a good season but Paul McCallum had the greatest season in the history of the CFL.  30 consecutive field goals and the highest percentage of successful field goals ever.  Neither record will ever be broken.  He even made a couple of touchdown saving tackles and no other kicker in the world does that.  Come on.......Paul McCallum IS the outstanding Canadian player this year!!!!  even if he got robbed of the chance to be named so</text>

	<text>Lulay deserves it. Lulay plays in a tougher division and has, arguably, less to work with. If only we could split the award between these two outstanding quaterbacks. I think either would take the Grey Cup over an individual award.</text>

	<text>If Messam does not win the Cdn award with all the weekly and monthly awards he has received just got another Cdn player of the month award then something is seriously wrong... no shot on Whyte.. but he didn"t do something that Messam did which has not been done for 11 years...  Sherrit should get the Rookie as well... tough battle between Lulay and AC.. but with all the records AC has broken this year I would be shocked if he lost it. If the Als somehow win another Grey Cup this year I think AC will retire.. and then we will all see how bad of a football team Montreal really is without AC... they have been lucky that he has never really had a serious injury that has knocked him out for a full season or anything..</text>

	<text>Long ago I made a post about Lulay in which I mentioned that a wise old man once told me you usually have more time then you think you do.  And that someone should tell Lulay this as it appeared he was throwing the ball before he really had to - hurrying his throws so to speak, in the first few games of the year.

Well, someone must have told him cause he"s been great ever since.  Just like I said he would eventually be.  Just that the eventually took less time then I thought it would.

I"ll take some of the credit for Lulay"s arrival as a big time player!    

And if I had a vote - he"d get mine.

AC is a nice guy - but he"s been around soooo long.  
Time for new blood.  

Sorry A.C. - no Grey Cup for you!</text>

	<text>Solomon Elimimian deserves the Defensive Player award over both Freeman and Johnson. Johnson had half the tackles, no sacks and only 4 more INT"s considering the position. Freeman is close but only 6 more tackles with 2 more games played. Solomon had way more of an impact. Literally.</text>

	<text>You people who think that Lulay should win just because the Lions dominated the Als in ONE game are nuts... The Lions record was still the same as the Esks and Stamps so your team overall is no better than either of those teams... Yeah you can say that Edmonton and Calgary are lucky BC started 0-5.. but yer also lucky that after the Esks started 5-0 they went in a lull for 5-7 games or first place would have been decided in the west by week 10.  Cavillo will get this because of all the records he broke.  I hate the Als and I"m not a big fan of them.. but you have to give credit where it"s due..and Cavillo has smashed pretty much every record that exists for a QB.. this is Lulay"s first full season.. it"s like saying a guy who scores 30 goals in the NHL in his rookie year is going to be a superstar... we"ve seen what has happened to those before... done and not playing anymore.. even if the Lions somehow won the grey cup this year... until Lulay has proven that he can perform this way on a repeated basis.. he could still be a one shot wonder.  Time will tell how good he really will be.. but AC gets the MOP based on his performance and records broken.</text>

	<text>Shmeagol.... how do you figure Lulay has less to work with?? If I"m not mistaken, he"s got two of the leagues all time best receivers in Geroy and Arland Bruce. Calvillo has Richardson and arguably SJ Green to counter with... I"d say the receiving corps for these two are pretty comparable.</text>

	<text>@lionoil.  McCallum"s record is great, NO doubt about it.  But I don"t think I agree that it will never be broken.  All record are made to be broken unless somebody hit 100% of FG attempts...then it won"t be broken...until there"s a rule change where more than 1 FG can be awarded on 1 attempt</text>

	<text>@92"Stamps... Gotta agree with you, but the fact he didn"t start all season likely cost him the award nominee. Had he started all 18 games he would have been chosen over Messam. Should be a good battle between Messam and Cornish next year.</text>

	<text>Wow. I have watched every game this season and I just don"t understand some of those picks. Some of the inequity comes from taking one from the East and one from the West. For example, how Elimimian and Cornish aren"t top 2 in the league in their groups is beyond me. In some ways, the same can be said for selections at the team level. MOP battle should be between Lulay and Richardson, not AC. This year, the snubs were in the nomination process, not in the final winner selection. The system needs to be revamped.</text>

	<text>Last time I checked MOP awards were based on one season not a career, besides Cavillo has already won it 2 of the last 3 years. And the reason the Lions won the West was going 6-2 against Edm and Cal. Esks falter down the stretch included 3 losses to BC.</text>

	<text>I personnally think it could be a toss up between Calvillo and Lulay but come on, the last game of the season isn"t the only we should consider...You"ve got to look at the defenses both QB"s were facing.  Calvillo faced probably the best defense in the CFL which was unbreakable in the second half of the season.  Lulay faced a defense a miserable defense who had like 5 back ups in the secondary.  Calvillo would surely torch his own defense if he had the chance to play against them...In the end, both are great QBs and their team could not be there without them...</text>

	<text>@oilers4ever08 - career records don"t make a single season MOP.  While I do agree that AC"s overall season numbers were better than Lulay"s and he is the better selection, don"t simply state that because he broke some career stats he"s the best player this year.  That"s like saying Gretzky should have been handed the Hart Trophy every year in his twilight because of his career stats.  The MVP, or MOP, trophy goes to the player who had great numbers and the greatest impact on his team"s performance.......</text>

	<text>However you want to word there Captain.. point being.. AC is the better QB this year.. stats show it... as someone pointed out, he had the better D to play three or four times in the Bombers... And I will say arguably, other than the Esks D which was up there all year with the Bombers... the Stamps and Riders D both sucked...   You have a point on overall career numbers but even still.  I have a hard time picking Lulay.. if he was that good of MOP, BC would not have started 0-5.</text>

	<text>Oilers4ever08: Talk about having the blinders on. If going 0-5 at the start of the season precludes Lulay from an MOP award in your judgment, how do you rationalize Calvillo"s 0-3 record at the end of the season when winning even one of those games was crucial? Not that I agree with your frame of reference anyway which seems to assume that it is impossible for an outstanding player to play on a losing team, which is of course, a ridiculous assumption.</text>

	<text>darkwing99 and 92stamps.  I do understand your loyalty but come on give Messam the kudos he deserves.  Messam didn"t start from the beginning of the season either.  If you remember, he had to compete with Daniel Porter and Arkee Witloc.  As I said though, I understand your loyalty.  I feel the same way about Fred Stamps.  I think that if he didn"t have abdominal surgery in the middle of the season, he would have been MOP but he did and he isn"t.  Cornish is a great younge player and will do well in this league.</text>

	<text>Before the teams announced their nominees for most outstanding player I thought Jaml Richardson should have been nominated for Montreal.  He had the most dominant season by a receiver since Simon in 2006.  Seeing as it is AC vs. Lulay and they have very simlar numbers, i can see th vote being very close.  Slight edge might go to AC due to all the records he broke this season, even though that shouldn"t factor into choosing the award winner.  As for Jovon Johnson vs. Freeman, if Johnson doesn"t win it will be a disgrace.  Swaggerville, led by JOhnson, had the number one ranked defense in the league giving up  a league-low 300 yards per game.  Saskatchewan had one of the worst defenses giving up nearly 400 yards per game.  Johnson in a walk.</text>

	<text>Not taking anything away from either one of these guys but I"m not sure why Anthony Calvillo is on here from his team.  I would say Richardson was more "outstanding" than AC all year.  And Lulay is probably the most "outstanding" this last 1/2 of the year and seems to be getting more confident every game.  Having the likes of Simon and Bruce can"t hurt either.  Is MOP usually a QB?</text>

	<text>I have lots of respect for AC but i just dont get this. Calvillo wasnt even the best player on the Als this season. His numbers are not what they are, with out the amzing season Richadson had. I am far from an Als fan and could care less whether they win or loose but i hate seeing a great season over looked because the Quaterback had a good season and the quarterback always wins the award. As for Lulay absolutly the right choice. wasnt on the same page as his receivers early but when they clicked he took off. Lulay, MOP hands down.</text>

	<text>Had Cornish been starting the full season he would have probably got the nomination as his yards per touch is just ridiculous. So got no problem with Messam"s nod. Also got no problem with McCallum for special teams player. The guy was money. And the special teams award is the one spot where a kicker can and should be recognized if his numbers warrant. With that said I do really have a problem with Sean Whyte being the East nomineee for Top Canadian. There had to be some other Canadian in the East that distinguished  himself isn"t there.</text>

Cavillo has better stats, plus he was screwed last yearr by who ever votes for this award. Hoping Cavillo gets it , he should get it but with the obvious Western bias that exists he probably won"t.</text>

	<text>Lulay had an outstanding season after the first third, but Calvillo"s season was routinely superb. His performance is taken for granted - "expected". I would have selected Richardson from the Als this year, but Calvillo still surpassed 5,000 yards, and a QB"s role in a RB getting their yards Whitaker should not be overlooked. If Lulay can get the Lions to the Grey Cup and maybe win it, that would be sweet. My guess is he"ll need to do it against Calvillo and the Als...</text>

	<text>1st, I think AC couldn`t care less about this award. Sure it`s allways nice but his mind is on 3pete nothin else. 2nd. for the debate, AC`s numbers were down this year but still ahead of any other QB in the CFL including Lulay so he should get it just because of that but if he doesn`t...no sweat, he won`t lose sleep over it.</text>

	<text>The fact that Chip Cox will once again end the year without a most outstanding defensive player award is a bit ridiculous. In my opinion, he"s been the best defensive player in the league every year since Cameron Wake went South. As for overall MOP, i agree with the CFL panel that Jamel Richardson should have been nominated and won rather than Calvillo. For Canadians, i believe Jon Cornish should have been chosen over Messam. I agree with the other selections. It will be interesting seeing who wins the special teams award, a kicker who broke two CFL records or a top returner. I hope the kicker wins but i doubt it.</text>

explain to me how he played poorer this year
some of you look at the 2 games and judge him on the whole season
what about the 15 games where he just kept on racking up the yards

i just dont get it
what does this old guy have to do to impress you
is it because he is a pocket passer and not flashy and flamboyant like burris or lulay

bottom line whos the guy who has survived for over 13 or 14 years, set records behaved in a professional manner

It"s MOP not MVP, his stats are better, and he set the all time records. Clearly it"s not gonna be a blow out, but it"s still in the bag.

	<text>@brownridge1979 Lulay has just as much chance as AC, here is why. When AC met the hottest team in the league after they meshed he threw WAY less than 100 yards and was chased. Setting all time records has nothing to do with this year, it is the culmination of many years, this award is for this year. Lulay took a 0-5 team as a very inexperienced QB in this league and 4 people who never caught a pass in the cfl on a tear to finish tops in the league with slightly less yards, slightly more INTs and the same TDs with more rushing yards than a vet who had many good solid veteran receivers from game 1. Im not saying give it to Lulay, Im saying he has just as much a chance and nothing is in the bag.</text>

	<text>I think it says a lot when the only unanimous selection was Paul McCallum.  I also think Messam is a shoe-in for top Canadian, but the number of CFL players who had truly outstanding seasons in 2011 is not that high.  In a playoff game I would take Cavillo over Lulay, mainly for his experience, but this award is based on the current regular season, so I"m predicting Lulay wins the MOP award, even though his numbers aren"t spectacular.  I don"t know how Cavillo got the numbers he did this year, I can think of four games where he played terrible.</text>

I went to Vancouver on vacation in August I live in Ontario and my son in law commented that the Lions, at the time, were awful. I remember saying that they had a good QB in Lulay. True story and Lulay turned them around. This Als fan says Lulay for MVP.</text>

	<text>Lulay"s completion percentage is so low because for the first six games of the year, his receivers couldn"t catch a ball to save their lives. This is when the Lions were starting guys like Dobson "Dropson" Collins, before they had Bruce, etc. Had even half of those been caught, Lulay would probably have 5200 yards and 35 TDs, not 4800 and 32. AC will win the award because of the people who vote on it, but I"d pick Lulay.</text>

	<text>With everyone logic on who should be MOP then the MOP should be Drew Tate.  He has three starts and is 100% in all of his starts.  He is a rookie by all standards... he beat both Montreal and Winnipeg in very important games.  Think about it folks before you start putting Stats up... The player that should get MOP is Lulay.  He brought a team from the depth of nowhere to first in the League.  He beat out Mr. Calvillo in the most important game and the last game of the season.  It was the true test of who is the MOP of the season.  Calvillo fell flat on his face.  Lulay rose to the the occasion.  Can"t argue with reality folks... Calvillo was consistent but Lulay is the better QB... if he wasn"t the Larks would of won one of the last three games.</text>

	<text>Stats are important but they are only a part of the picture when defining an outstanding player in a given year. If individual stats are the only factor that should be considered, then why not just have the league statistician tally up the stats sheets at the end of the season and announce the winners in each category on that basis alone? Hell, he wouldn"t even have to watch the games. I tend to think that making tough plays at critical times, handling pressure, improvising to make things happen when everything around you is breaking down, and an ability to carry your team when things are not going well are just a few of the essential elements of an MOP that do not show up on a stats sheet.</text>

	<text>First of all, with all due respect to Mr. Freeman, a very good player, no one on that defense on that team should be up for this award.  As to MOP Calvillo may win though he shouldn"t but I"m sure glad we have Lulay.  I"d take him over any other current CFL QB in a heartbeat!</text>

	<text>First, for you guys comparing Elimimian and Freeman, and doing your best to disrespect the other -- wait, I guess that"s just the BC fans doing that, what else is new -- I think you lose sight of the fact that they are both great players.  Sure, I"d probably take Elimimian, too, partially because he"s in the middle, but Freeman has been absolutely tremendous, and he"s hardly been surrounded by great talent.  I see no reason to disregard either one of these guys, they are both significant players.

As for Lulay vs Calivillo, well, it"s almost a toss-up for me, but Lulay"s team has been 11-2 once they got it together, and his elements of misdirection, running, leadership and youthful exuberance give him the nod in my estimation.  I would pick Lulay.</text>

	<text>Who cares what BC"s record was in the last 13 games, they went 11-7 to finish the year. Two other teams in the west did as well. Lulay is pretty good, but some of you make him out to be the second coming. It"s a team game and BC has a good one. Having said that, if AC wins, that would be pretty dissapointing.</text>

	<text>let me get this right
lulay deserves it even though his 1st 6 or 7 games of the season were crap
but because of timing for the remainder of the games he deserves the win over someone who showed and proved overall for the season with 2 bad games that he should win
you must be kidding
then all your arguments are based on finishing strong
not overall for the year
 i hope some of you would put this in perspective
what if calvillo would have had his 1st 3 games of the year 
poor as you know what
then he would have torn up the other teams for his remaining games
what would your vote be then
all i can say is
take the complete year as a whole
then look at his stats

some of you are being blinded by

one 
 calvillos name is always mentioned and many of you are tired of hearing his name

two
he is boring to watch
three
you just want to see someone new win it
maybe a young gun
hope this helps in determing who is truely rightious
isnt it about the whole year

where would have the alouettes have finished if he did not play
thibk about it
where would richardson have finished if calvillo wasnt behind the ball</text>

	<text>Ticats vs Als, each blew the other out once/ the other 2 were hard fought/ Als get nod at home but Ticats as up/down as they have been havent loss 3 in a row all season/ frankly playing at home last two yrs didnt help/ if the Cats that hammered BC and Montreal earlier this year show up look out/ just as likely the Cats who played big games against the Peg and Edmonton and looked lost/ I wouldnt characterize the Cats as underdogs here/ they have proved they can play/beat anyone soundly/ problem is also the most unpredictable/inconsistent team in CFL by far..</text>

	<text>BeatInTheEast, I gave you a - just because I was winded by the time I finished reading.  Ever think of using a period or apostrophe?  LOL.  In all seriousness, I would pick Lulay... period.  That"s just my feeling on it.  However, I would have been more challenged with it if JR was on the Eastern ballot, I think, because I was surprised AC got the nod over him.</text>

	<text>Well Beast, there is a lot of subjectivity involved in selecting MOPs and everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, the rationale behind your criticism of the people who would chose Lulay is as confusing as your decision to attempt to communicate without the use of punctuation what"s with that, anyway?. I really don"t think people are "tired of hearing Calvillo"s name", they simply think that on balance Lulay and Richardson, for that matter had a better year.</text>

	<text>Surprised that Lions picked K Williams over Elimimiam for defensive player - although the BC newspapers had mentioned how the Lions coached were leaning towards the former. Williams had a great season, but Elimimian was definitely noticed a lot more by fans and media of other cities. I think that the two games he missed cost him his shot. Lulay definitely had a great second half and should be considered based on his winning record and leadership. AC is a great quarterback, but his team faltered and his numbers suffered in the last part of the season. J Richardson definitely deserved the nod from Montreal.</text>

	<text>I give full credit to Lulay and Wally Buono. Great turn around for a no-talent team. I still feel it is always better going into games being an underdog.</text>
