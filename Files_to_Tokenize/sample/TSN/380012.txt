	<text>(Sports Network) - Flyers defencemanChris&nbsp;Prongerwill wear a visor in his return from a serious eye injury tonight when Philadelphia visits the Tampa Bay Lightning at the St. Pete Times Forum.Pronger suffered the injury against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Oct. 24 when the stick ofMikhail&nbsp;Grabovskistruck Pronger on a follow through from a shot. Pronger has missed the last six games.You can watch the game live on TSN2 and TSN Mobile TV at 7:30pm et/4:30pm pt and join&nbsp;the TSN.ca Game Night Blog to chat with other hockey fans during the game.The league's current leaders in goals scored, the Flyers try to extend their four-game point streak this evening and slow downSteven&nbsp;Stamkosand the Lightning.A former 51-goal scorer in 2009-10, Stamkos finished second in the NHL last year with 45 goals, but had just one tally through his first five games. However, the 21-year-old center has nine goals in his last nine games, netting a hat trick in last Friday's win over the Blackhawks before notching a goal and an assist in Sunday's 4-3 come-from-behind shootout victory over the Panthers.Stamkos is tied with Buffalo'sThomas&nbsp;Vanekfor second in the league in goals scored with 10, one behind the leaderPhil&nbsp;Kesselof Toronto, and has tallied eight times in 12 career games versus the Flyers.The Lightning have scored 43 goals on the season, tied for sixth-best in the league, while the Flyers are topping all clubs with 56 goals on the season. That is a bit of a surprise given that Philadelphia traded away two of its top goal scorers this past offseason in captainMike&nbsp;Richardsand forwardJeff&nbsp;Carter.&quot;I don't think anybody expected that,&quot; said Flyers forwardDanny&nbsp;Briereof his team leading the league in goals at this point. &quot;Obviously, we lost a lot of firepower, but a lot of guys are stepping up.Nearly the whole roster stepped up in Philadelphia's last game, a 9-2 victory over Columbus. Eight different players scored goals and 15 Flyers had at least one point. RookieSean&nbsp;Couturierwas the lone multi-goal scorer, posting his first career two-goal game, and bothJames&nbsp;van&nbsp;Riemsdykand former Blue JacketJakub&nbsp;Voracektallied a goal and two assists.Claude&nbsp;Girouxtallied for the ninth time this year andJaromir&nbsp;Jagrscored and had an assist to give him six goals and five assists over a seven-game point streak.Ilya&nbsp;Bryzgalovmade 33 saves to give Philadelphia a 3-0-1 record in its past four games.&quot;I think it was just nice to come out and play well,&quot; Flyers head coach Peter Laviolette said. &quot;I think from the start we did the right things, pucks went in the net and I think more than anything we wanted to play the game the right way and because of that you get results you're looking for.&quot;DefensemanErik&nbsp;Gustafssonrecorded the first point of his NHL career with an assist and finished the game a plus-6. The Flyers' offense may have another weapon back tonight in rookieMatt&nbsp;Read, who could return after missing the last three games with an upper-body injury.Stamkos, meanwhile, was part of a team effort on Sunday that saw the Lightning rally from three goals down to beat the Panthers in a shootout.Teddy&nbsp;Purcellhad the game-tying goal in the third period to complete the rally andDominic&nbsp;Moorescored the winner in the shootout's fourth round.Mathieu&nbsp;Garonstarted the game, but made only nine saves before his exit.Dwayne&nbsp;Rolosonstopped all 28 shots he faced in relief to give the Lightning their sixth victory in eight games.&quot;I don't know how many times I've been throw in [in relief, but] I don't think we've ever come back to get a win,&quot; Roloson said. &quot; Give our guys a lot of credit. We stuck with our game plan and battled back.&quot;ForwardRyan&nbsp;Malonejoined Stamkos as a second-period scorer, but did not play in the third frame due to an upper-body injury.Victor&nbsp;Hedmanmissed the game entirely with an upper-body issue and both players are questionable for this game.Philadelphia snapped a three-game slide to Tampa Bay in the final meeting between the teams last year and has taken six of the past nine encounters. The Flyers have won four of their last five trips to the Forum.</text>

	<text>Like I said at the beginning Flyers DO NOT miss Carter, and only mis Richards a little bit. Giroux is looking like a superstar, Richards is a good player but he wasn"t elite like Crosby and Ovechkin. I hope Giroux can establish himself with those two, he does have the skill but does he have the drive an passion.</text>

	<text>I hope they come out strong and play a full 60minutes. The last three years they have been awful after 3 days off. Couturier was worth it for Carter, anything that Voracek gets is a bonus. Still think that Sean should be 3rd line center with Read and Simmonds instead of playing 4th with Talbot and Nodl/Rinaldo/Shelly.</text>

	<text>sorry Flyerfan69, the flyers do not miss either of these players. Carter is a one trick ponystreaky goal scorer and Richards is a good two player with a little offensive upside. Giroux on the other hand was already on the PK unit while Richards was with the team and still is and he is more gifted offensivley than 90% of the players in the league. But the one thing Giroux has that you cant teach or coach is passion, you can tell he loves to play the game and doesnt shy away when the going gets tough.  Lets Go Flyers.  glad to see Pronger back practicing, the Flyers need him out there badly.</text>

	<text>Flyers have issues on defense. Pronger and Timonen don"t have many years of good hockey left and their prospects on defense aren"t very interesting. It will be important to draft good d-men in the next few years. Drafting Kevin Marshall just before PK Subban hurts.</text>

	<text>As relieved as I am to have Pronger back in the lineup, im equally as excited to get rookie Matt Read back.  He seems to have serious skills and reminds me a lot of Patrick Sharp.  Hopefully the Flyers don"t screw this one up again and trade him right before he breaks out.  Does anyone else think Matt Read has that kind of potential or am I way off?</text>

	<text>I am so glad to have Pronger back.  He"ll log the big minutes, quarter back the powerplay and take some heat off of the other defencemen.  He"ll also help Matt Carle who can"t tie his skates without Pronger watching him.  I am really glad he"s ok because that was scary what happened.</text>
