	<text>&nbsp;A lot changes in the CFL from one season to the next.Players come and go, there's usually a new head coach or two and some long-time star players will find themselves replaced by young up-and-comers.But the one thing that almost never changes is the fact that the West Division is better than the East.Over each of the past two regular seasons, it appeared as if that dynamic might be about to change.A year ago, both the B.C. Lions and Edmonton Eskimos got off to dreadful starts while the once-awful Toronto Argonauts became the surprise team of the season's first half. But when all was said and done by the end of the season, the West had amassed a better overall record than the East for the eighth time in nine seasons.This season, it was B.C. and Saskatchewan in the West that got out of the gate slowly, going a combined 2-12 through the first six weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the East's Winnipeg Blue Bombers came out of nowhere to string together the league's best record early on, winning seven of their first eight games.But yet again, after 19 weeks of regular season play, the West has emerged with the overall better record - again.More important is how the West has dominated during the final few weeks of the regular season headed towards the playoffs.During the final four weeks of the regular season, the three West Division playoff teams won a total of nine games, the East Division's trio just three. And the three Eastern teams headed for the post-season - Winnipeg, Montreal and Hamilton - were a combined 0-6 during the final two weeks of the season.Winnipeg won the East going 3-7 during their final two games while Montreal finished second despite a three-game losing streak to close the season. Hamilton, meanwhile, dropped four of its last five, including losses to bottom-dwellers Toronto and Saskatchewan.Not one Eastern team matched the record of all three playoff teams in the West (11-7) which, unless Montreal can find its groove back quickly, looks like a strong bet to produce its first Grey Cup winner since Calgary in 2009.(Not to take anything away from Montreal's success over the past 10 years or so, but making it to the Grey Cup through the East Division hasn't exactly been a minefield over that span.)Don't bother for looking for ways to explain this phenomenon. It defies explanation in a league where all teams play with the same resources and balanced schedules.It's like the CFL's version of gravity. It just is.Now, some other thoughts on Week 19 and a Look Ahead to this weekend's Division Semi-Finals.--The Roughriders' decision to retain Brendan Taman as general manager is sure to be met with mixed response in Saskatchewan. Taman has been the object of fan resentment over the team's plummet in the standings following the Riders back-to-back Grey Cup appearances in '09 and '10, teams that were largely built by former GM Eric Tillman. However, it would have been tough for the organization to make Taman the scapegoat, given that he was working under the authority of Ken Miller, who has held the title VP of Football operations the past two seasons, a title that came with final authority over all decisions.Taman, a Saskatoon native, who worked for the Riders as a player personnel assistant during the 1990s, joined Saskatchewan for the 2009 season when Tillman's status was in limbo over his legal problems. When Tillman resigned after that season, Taman was handed the GM title. But the team then decided to give Miller the VP of Football Operations title, in addition to his role as head coach.Both Miller and Taman have said publicly that the two reached decisions together, and rarely disagreed. But even if that's true, how does Taman take the fall for the result of a process that he did not control.It wasn't his decision to hire Greg Marshall as head coach, nor his decision to fire him, and it's fair to question both moves.Taman will get the opportunity to hire a head coach and build the team how he sees fit. But given that he must share some responsibility for this season's disappointment, no GM will begin the 2012 season on a hotter seat than Taman.Meanwhile, in Toronto, the review of the 2011 season is underway, the results of which will go to a long way to determining whether head coach and GM Jim Barker comes back in both roles, one role or neither. An announcement on Barker's status may not come until after the Grey Cup.--While the B.C. Lions are the league's hottest team going into the playoffs (winners of 10 of their past 11), the most intriguing team may be the Calgary Stampeders. The Stamps have rebuilt on the fly this season, changing-up personnel on defence and sitting down future Hall of Famers Joffrey Reynolds and Henry Burris on the offensive side of the ball. Calgary has been a different team since those changes were made, with Cornish continuing to show the ability he'd competently displayed in a reserve role, and Tate looking as competent in his first few starts as any CFL quarterback since Ricky Ray made his CFL debut.Cornish has started seven games for Calgary and Tate just three.Based on those games alone, here's how their stats would have projected over an 18 game season.Cornish&nbsp;&nbsp; Yards Rushing:&nbsp; 1,571&nbsp;&nbsp; TD's: 15Tate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yards Passing:&nbsp; 4,746&nbsp;&nbsp; TD's: 24&nbsp;&nbsp; Int's: 30The presence of Tate provides an interesting dynamic to this year's West Division semifinal, given that the Eskimos haven't seem much of the 27-year-old this season. Tate has rallied the Stamps with three consecutive victories to close the season, despite throwing more interceptions than touchdowns over that span. He has quickly demonstrated that, unlike a lot of young quarterbacks, he is not prone to locking in on particular target or two. Tate hit 10 different receivers during his first start, nine during his second and eight during his third, which should serve notice to the Eskimo defence that he will try to spread the ball around against them as well.--Speaking of Cornish, he and Edmonton's Jerome Messam accomplished something that may not have been done in the long history of the CFL, or at least in quite some time: they managed to become the first two Canadian running backs to finish in the top-five in league rushing with Messam cracking the 1,000-yard mark at 1,057 on the season and Cornish not behind at 863, with a better yards per carry average. (Messam is the first Canadian running back to crack 1,000 yards in a season since Sean Millington in 2000.) The fact that Messam and Cornish will go head-to-head during the first round of playoffs is an ideal way to showcase their talents after two outstanding seasons.--In a year where no team dominated, it seemed like you could determine winners each week in the CFL based solely to whichever team won the turnover battle. The only exception to this was Calgary, which managed to tie for the league-lead with 11 wins while finishing with a giveaway/takeaway margin of minus-4.--While the focus in Hamilton has understandably been on the unfolding quarterback situation, the key to beating Montreal may lie in their ability to establish their run game. In the two games in which Hamilton defeated Montreal this season, Avon Cobourne averaged 85 yards on the ground while in the two losses, he averaged just 19. That's similar to the pattern established over the course of the season, where a balanced attack was the key to Hamilton's offence. So much of that will depend on whether the Tiger-Cats fall behind early, which has been a problem for them this season. Montreal in its two most recent playoff games at Olympic Stadium - the two most recent East Division finals - has jumped on its opponents early and turned them into one dimensional team, which for Hamilton would be a problem. And perhaps part of why the Tiger-Cats were 0-7 when trailing at halftime this season.--Back to the Hamilton quarterback situation for a moment. While head coach Marcel Bellefeuille was clear with both Kevin Glenn and Quinton Porter about how the situation would be managed during the final few weeks of the season - no quick hooks, no going in for just a single series -- that figures to change this week. Over the last several weeks, which Hamilton's playoff spot was already determined, Bellefeuille has had the luxury of not having to worry about wins and losses, as much as that both his quarterbacks were getting the necessary game time. It's part of his theory that winning three playoff games will require both quarterbacks at some point and hence the notion of getting Porter ready without - hopefully - getting Glenn's nose out of joint. But worrying about the feelings of his quarterbacks will end this week with a playoff game. And it will be interesting to see with so much on the line, how long Bellefeuille will stick with Glenn. The Glenn-Porter experience has been in place for three seasons now, and has produced a combined record of 26-28, with two playoff losses. They've tried to upgrade special teams, the secondary and the running game from a year ago. Have to figure that a loss this Sunday means quarterback will be the next place in Hamilton to get a shakeup.--The 2011 Toronto Argonaut season will be remembered as a disappointing one in which the team underachieved and made itself easy to ignore, with attendance hovering just above or below 20,000 all season. There are many layers as to why the CFL continues to struggle in the Centre Of The Universe, but let's just say the product on the field hasn't helped. Canadian football is about throwing the football. When teams do that well, they are exciting to watch. And when they do it poorly, they are not. Here is where the Toronto Argonauts have ranked in recent seasons when it comes to moving the all through the air.2011 - Last2010 - Last2009 - Seventh2008 - Fifth2007 - Seventh2006 - Last--How long has it been since the Hamilton Tiger-Cats won a playoff game? Well, you have to go back to 2001 when the Cats hosted the division semifinal and defeated Montreal, before going on and losing the East Division final at Winnipeg. Not a single player on the Hamilton roster right now has won a playoff game in gold-and-black. Since Hamilton last tasted playoff victory, the Alouettes have won 11 post-season games and three Grey Cups.--Beyond the Montreal Alouettes failing to hit the 12-win mark for just the second time since returning to the CFL in 1996, the Als had far more games this season in which they simply didn't look ready or willing - highlighted by their 43-1 loss to B.C. on Saturday night.Injuries have been a big part of the story in Montreal this season but this is a team that almost never beat itself, which is why their oppositions felt so much pressure to be perfect when the played against them. But in several games this season the Als just didn't seem to have it and in others there were instances where the old Als would have seized a chance to win a game in the final minute, but this season came up short.The Als had the leagues leading passer, receiver and rusher this season and their defence was middle of the pack in most categories (albeit better against the run than the pass.) But it all added up to just a 10-8 record.It's not impossible that Montreal could rattle off three consecutive wins and find themselves hoisting another Grey Cup. But for the first time since Mark Trestman took over before the 2009 season they are definitely not the Grey Cup favourites going into the playoffs.</text>

	<text>Anything can happen and usually does in the playoffs. Besides BC and Calgary going into the playoffs on a positive note, you could make a good point for any of the six teams to make it to the Grey Cup. One thing for sure, if the Lions make it to the big game, they are going to certainly have the support of thousands of fans which could make it hard on any team from the East. Go Bombers</text>

	<text>I like how Naylor just ignores the fact that an eastern team the Als won the last 2 Grey Cups in declaring that the Western teams are always better than the Eastern teams. I guess my geography is all wrong and Montreal moved west in 2009! The point may be that some individual teams in the east were not as strong as the teams in the west, but the Als have always been competitive against the Western teams. Stupid commentary, but not unexpected.</text>

	<text>Dave Naylor, you have really improved as a reporter over the years. You are now, in my view, the best CFL insider. For too long the news on the CFL has never gone too deep. You now take it to a new level. Strange how the Argos have been so inept at offence. It"s as if there is a conspiracy to drive the team under so the NFL will be brought in. Just can"t seem to think of any other way that a team could be this bad. BTW, very poor decision for offensive coordinator. Need an experienced man here. As for the Ti-cats, Porter doesn"t seem to being getting any better. Not sure why he is still around. Another conspiracy theory, perhaps?</text>

	<text>jlsstats - Stamps beat the eskimos by ten.  That Lewis touchdown was worth seven.  Just incase you didn"t know.  Calgary is the leagues best road team and the only team to not lose since Tate took over.  Only game in Edmonton?  Calgary won.  Two games in B.C.? 65-65 total score.  Tate is too good.  Stamps by 10.5 on Sunday.</text>

	<text>Hear, hear, here, here, Naylor!  It"s really nice to hear someone in the media make note of that -- "making it to the Grey Cup through the East Division hasn"t exactly been a minefield" over the past 10 years.  Most make statements like how the Als are a dynasty of sorts, but I can tell you that of the 8 times the Als made it through the East, they would have been lucky to make it two or three through the West.  How do I know that?  Because my Stamps have probably been a better team over the past 10 years than the Als... and they"ve had to claw and fight to make it the two or three times they did.  The level of fight in the Eastern teams is finally catching up, I think.  I actually like the Als chances this year, but I don"t think it"s going to be quite the walk in the park it has been for them.  However, when all is said and done, it"s about time someone in the media stepped up to admit all of this.  I just can"t bow to a team and call them a dynasty when they"ve had such an easy go of it.  Thanks Naylor!</text>

	<text>What part of "regular season" do some of you posters not get. He did not once say anything about the west being better than the east in post season play. The whole commentary has to do with the west being stronger than the east during regular season play. Everyone knows that all you have to do is make it to the post season and then anything can happen in the play-offs. It"s a whole new season.</text>

	<text>This Stamps fan will be the first to admit it; I wrote off the BC Lions in Week 6 + 7. Now they look like they could steal the whole season. Good on ya Wally and friends. ... But, I still like the Stamps chances now that everyone is 0-0. If Cornish can put up 150 on the ground with 2 TD"s in a Victory - it will put another nail in the coffin of Joffrey Reynold"s reign as Calgary"s #1 running back. Thanks for the years Joffrey, now it"s the Corn-Dog"s time.</text>

	<text>The West dominance likely has to do with the GM"s and coaches these teams have had over the last few years.  On the West side you have the likes of Wally Buono, John Hufnagel, and Eric Tillman.  On the East side, Jim Popp is really the only one worth mentioning. The West dominance over the last 9 years is more than a coincidence.</text>

	<text>That Montreal won the last two Cups means that Montreal won the last two Cups, not that the east Winnipeg, Hamilton and lets not forget, Toronto- see the story above is better.  Montreal has been the only team in the east competitive with the west, for the last decade, until this season.  The east has approached the west except at QB where only Montreal has a good #1.  Lion_Heart, I don"t know about the Lions" market value.  Football is a distant 3rd to hockey and street crime in Vancouver.  It is a tough sell.  Not like Toronto, but tough.</text>

	<text>I don"t follow hockey, but haven"t the past 10 Cups gone to US teams, ergo the US play better hockey.  Ugh!  Not a good argument is it?One can dig up the seasons" games for say the last ten years and look at the outcomes of wet vs. east teams and the west dominates.  Recall the playoff crossover rule came in because the 4th place western team often had a better record than the two lowest teams in the east.  That"s it.  It"s not good.  It"s how it has been.  It"s good to see the ascendency of Winnipeg and Hamilton this last season, but they need QBs before they are really competitive.  Nest season: lots of retirements, some defections to the NFL.  Things might, just might, get closer.  By the way, I believe the NFL has stated its position on expansion: 1. very slow; 2. Los Angeles.</text>
