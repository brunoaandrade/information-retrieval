	<text>(Sports Network) - The Ottawa Senators were one of the hottest teams in the league just over a week ago, but they have dropped three in a row as the welcome the New York Rangers to Scotiabank Place on Wednesday.You can watch the game live on TSN, TSN Mobile TV and TSN.ca at 7:30pm et/4:30pm pt and join our Game Night Blog to chat with other hockey fans during the game.Senators captainDaniel&nbsp;Alfredssonskated with the team on Wednesday morning but there is no timetable for his return from a concussion. Senators head coach Paul MacLean said Alfredsson has passed the baseline tests and concussion protocol but he is in no rush to put&nbsp;the veteran&nbsp;back in the lineup.&nbsp;Rangers&nbsp;forwardWojtek&nbsp;Wolskiunderwent surgery to repair a sports hernia earlier this week and is expected to be sidelined four weeks.After a pair of regulation losses, the Sens managed to earn a point in Saturday's shootout loss against visiting Buffalo.Derek&nbsp;Royscored to cap the sixth round of the shootout, giving the Sabres a 3-2 triumph in Canada's capital city.Milan&nbsp;MichalekandJason&nbsp;Spezzascored in the shootout phase for Ottawa. Michalek andErik&nbsp;Condraalso tallied during regulation for the Senators.&quot;They got lucky in the shootout,&quot; Michalek said. &quot;We have to keep learning from this and be confident.&quot;Craig&nbsp;Andersonmade 31 saves, but couldn't hold off Roy, who wristed a shot into the top right corner of the net to end the contest.Senators captainDaniel&nbsp;Alfredssonhas missed four games since suffering a concussion against the Rangers on Oct. 29. Alfredsson, who has four goals and three assists in 10 games this season, began skating earlier this week, but he won't be in the lineup tonight.Tonight marks the end of a three-game homestand for the Sens, who are 5-3-1 as the host this season. Following this evening's contest, Ottawa will head out on a six-game road trip and begin a stretch of nine road tilts in 10 games.Ottawa defeated the Rangers, 5-4, in a shootout on Oct. 29 and the Sens have taken two in a row and three out of five in this series. However, New York has won its last five trips to Scotiabank Place.The streaking New York Rangers will take aim at a fifth consecutive victory tonight.The Rangers began the season with a modest 3-3-3 record, but since then New York has posted four straight victories and outscored the opposition by a 15-6 margin during that stretch.The four straight wins marks New York's longest winning streak since it rattled off five victories in a row from March 12-22 of last season.New York's latest victory came Sunday on home ice, asMartin&nbsp;Bironmade 23 saves to record his first shutout in a Rangers uniform and the Blueshirts skated to a 3-0 victory over the Winnipeg Jets.&quot;We showed some resilience, some battle and some heart,&quot; Biron said.Marian&nbsp;Gaborikhad two goals and an assist for the Rangers. Gaborik leads New York in both goals (7) and points (13) this season and the Slovakian winger has two goals and three assists over a current three-game point streak.Derek&nbsp;Stepanadded a goal and an assist in Sunday's win.Biron, meanwhile, improved his record this season to 3-0. He has stopped 77- of-80 shots sent his way this season while serving as the backup toHenrik&nbsp;Lundqvist.Lundqvist&nbsp;will be back in the crease tonight for the Rangers. The Swede is 10-11-2 with a 2.01 goals-against average in 24 career games against Ottawa.In other news for the Rangers, forwardWojtek&nbsp;Wolskiwill undergo surgery to correct a sports hernia and will miss four weeks of action. Wolski has been limited to six games this season, during which he has totaled just a pair of assists.New York began the year on a seven-game road trip before playing its last six games at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers are 3-2-2 on the road.</text>

	<text>It will be 5 wins in a row after this one, dropping the puck is just a formality haha. I love how the Sens and Leafs get their fans all excited and thus make the fans super cocky and annoying, but look those teams are now playing to their true potential, GO RANGERS GO!</text>

	<text>Don"t be surprised if this game gets ugly, Avery will probably turtle as usual but Prust will take Neil or Konopka. Then it"s going to be the Spezza show, not sure which Spezza will show pass to your imaginary friends or actually shoot and score.  low score tonight 2-1 both goalies are playing well just one is winner more then the other.</text>

	<text>jimcanyou1, that is so clever. as i was reading your post, i was wondering where you were going with the whole "track" thing, but you delivered nicely by referring to the imaginary train that drives down a track on the staircases into basements.  what are you, 5?</text>

	<text>Yeah, what happened the last two times over-excited Canadian fanbases predicted a trouncing of the Rangers? Even if I was a Sens fan, I would at least want to sound like I knew what I was talking about. Therefore, I wouldn"t be picking them to beat up on a team that just won 4 straight.</text>

	<text>Sens are in tough without Alfie.  I don"t expect the Rangers to let them come back from 3 goals down again.  Anderson is the key.  Hope Rundblad is playing tonight.
But the Rangers are playing well.  Not the struggling team the Sens played 2 weeks ago.
Mr. Wolski.... KARMA is a BIT@@ -- isn"t it?</text>

	<text>Rangers are hot, Sens, not so much.  Logic would say Blueshirts take this one, but I wouldn"t underestimate the Sens, they"ve played respectably this year, and the Rangers remember well what happened last game.  I still think Rangers by 2, with one into the empty net.  Should be a fun game aren"t they all?.  Go Rangers!</text>

	<text>I"m not one of those fans that"s out for blood nor would I want to see any player get really hurt, but I gotta admit it would be nice to see Neil tune up one of the Rangers just to let them know Alfie"s concussion isn"t forgotten. That being said, it"d be even nicer to steal 2 points from a team that"s hot right now, right before a slew of road games. Steady as she goes boys, Go Sens Go.</text>

	<text>I got this game recording so I can watch it when I get home This whole working for a living thing sucks!. Here"s hoping to a great game. If its close, I"ll be happy because I got Spezza, Michalek and Lundqvist in my pool. How about 2-1 Ottawa with Spezz and Mich scoring and Lundqvists makes 34 saves. I would love that! GO SENS GO</text>

	<text>Let me break it down for other fans, Saying "Sens will be bottom feeders" is not a chirp. We are HAPPY to be there. Because we know BM will KEEP the pick and we get the pick of the litter and another piece to the rebuild. But I like your ethusiasm! ANd us wanting the team to win is not flip lopping. We WANT them to win but its OK if the finish last.</text>

	<text>I always view Sens/Rangers games with mixed emotions and hope for overtime. In a way, it"s just as well that Wolski is out for this one. His presence would be a distraction for the Sens and they might waste some energy trying to exact some revenge. Given the NHL seems dedicated to getting this whole incident wrong, someone on Ottawa would end up getting suspended, while Alfie stills sits out. As long as the Rangers struggle to generate offense, this should be a tight game. Ottawa wins 3-2 in OT.</text>

	<text>Rangerman, I agree. If retribution was to be delivered it should have been done in the last game.  "Nuff said about this topic, hopefully Alfredsson will be back during the road trip.  This is an important home game for the Sen"s who are trying to turn around a three game losing streak.  They"ve always seem to struggle on the western road trips so a win tonight would start things on the right foot.  No quit for 60 minutes and see what happens, should be a good one!</text>
