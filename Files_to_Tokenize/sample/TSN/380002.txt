	<text>TORONTO &ndash; The question hangs precariously in the air with no imminent answer in sight.James&nbsp;Reimer's return appears no closer to fruition as the Leafs' crease continues to wobble in his absence. Ron Wilson was forced to hook his starter for the second consecutive game on Tuesday as the Leafs dropped a 5-1 decision to the Panthers, the first time they've lost two games in a row all season &ndash; they were thumped 7-0 by the Bruins on Saturday.Toronto goaltending currently sits third-worst in the NHL (3.37 goals against average, .888 save percentage), struggles that were clearly on display at the Air Canada Centre on Tuesday night.Jose&nbsp;Theodorewas spectacular with 38 saves for the visiting Panthers, while the duo ofJonas&nbsp;GustavssonandBen&nbsp;Scrivensleaked five goals on 28 shots.&quot;Their goalie made a number of big saves and unfortunately we didn't get a save and that kind of sunk us,&quot; said Wilson, following the Leafs second regulation loss at home this season. &quot;We've got to shore up our goaltending obviously but play the way we did tonight and more often than not, the puck will go in the net.&quot;A dominant final two periods &ndash; the Leafs outshot the Panthers 31-14 &ndash; yielded little in the way of results, capped by a deflating spurt in the middle frame.Florida scored twice in a 19-second span on two plays that could hardly be considered scoring chances. A bouncing puck that skipped past Gustavsson behind the Leafs net keyedMarco&nbsp;Sturmfor the Panthers second goal withTomas&nbsp;Kopecky(they led 1-0 after the first) adding another seconds later, his shot innocently deflecting off the stick ofJohn-Michael&nbsp;Lilesand past the glove of the 26-year-old Swede. Scrivens took over from that point, but fared no better in relief, yielding two goals on just seven shots.&quot;We've got to support our goalies better and if it's a rough time for them, play better defensively,&quot; continued Wilson. &quot;But sometimes that's hard to do if you don't give up any chances and a puck's in the net and it's not a scoring chance &ndash; there's not much you can do.&quot;Suddenly exposed is the lack of stability in goal without Reimer, whose return remains shrouded in doubt. The 23-year-old missed his eighth consecutive game on Tuesday (upper-body) and has not been on the ice since Friday. He continues to work out off-ice, but does not look to be anywhere near a return.&quot;I really don't know,&quot; said Wilson. &quot;I can't comment on that because I simply don't know.&quot;The Leafs managed to brush over his absence initially with a high-powered and very timely offence; in the first six games without their number one (4-2-0), the Leafs scored 21 goals (3.5 per game) while still allowing three or more in four of those games. But with the offence suddenly stumbling &ndash; despite a number of great chances on Theodore &ndash; goaltending, and specifically the absence of Reimer, has magnified into a critical area of focus.Both goaltenders are fighting the puck &ndash; Scrivens was hooked after five goals on 14 shots against Boston &ndash; with no obvious option emerging for Thursday's game in St. Louis. Gustavsson was relatively sturdy &ndash; albeit with bloated numbers &ndash; making five straight starts in place of Reimer (3-2-0), but since Scrivens took over with two consecutive starts in his place &ndash; beginning with a 38-save performance in Columbus &ndash; his confidence looks to have been rattled yet again.Wilson indicated that he'd already decided which goaltender would start against the Blues, before adding, &quot;We'll make the decision at practice [Wednesday] or even the next day. I want to see how the goalies play in practice, how they rebound from this and go from there.&quot;--The Leafs played their ninth game of the season withoutTim&nbsp;Connolly. Connolly was injured (upper-body) early in the first period of Saturday's game against Boston and will miss up to two weeks.&quot;I kind of felt right away that there was something wrong, but just tried to battle through it,&quot; said Connolly, who indicated that the injury was sustained because of a cross-check early in the game. &quot;It was tough to get through the game, but it was a bit worse afterwards when the adrenaline does settle down. You never really want to take yourself out of a game no matter what the situation is.&quot;The 30-year-old missed only one shift, totaling over 16 minutes of ice-time in the loss. It's the second significant injury suffered by the Syracuse native in his brief stint with the Leafs; Connolly missed the first eight games of the regular season with an unrelated shoulder injury.--The parallels to last season are obvious toNikolai&nbsp;Kulemin. The 25-year-old had just one goal in October a year ago, but broke out for eight in November, finishing the year with a career-high 30. This fall, he's managed just two goals in the opening fifteen games, hoping for a similar explosion this month.&quot;In the start, it's hard physically sometimes,&quot; Kulemin told the Leaf Report. &quot;After you get used to it, play a lot in the games, [you] feel more comfortable on the ice.&quot;Kulemin had just 18 shots through the opening fourteen games, firing a season-high six shots on goal against the Panthers.&quot;I try to shoot it more,&quot; said Kulemin before the game, &quot;but I don't really have a chance to shoot in the game. When I have to shoot, I shoot now.&quot;--Luke&nbsp;Schennreturned to the lineup on Tuesday after sitting as a healthy scratch for the game against Boston.&quot;That was obviously a decision they made to sit me out a game and hopefully it's just a positive experience, you can learn from it, come back stronger and hopefully no looking back,&quot; said Schenn.Despite a minus-3 rating in 12 minutes and 38 seconds of ice-time against the Panthers, the 22-year-old appeared much more at ease.&quot;I thought Luke was much better,&quot; said Wilson. &quot;A lot more energized; he had seven hits and a lot of them were really hard ones that the other guy paid a price. He got victimized on what you'd call a couple of bad goals, but they certainly weren't Luke's fault.&quot;</text>

	<text>Please tell me why Gionta did not get suspended for his head shot to reimer. I know it does not help the LEAFS if he suspended or not but imagine it it were reversed and Keeesll hit Price like that. I am sure it would be more highly profiled. Can someone please answer that for me?</text>

	<text>I think it"s to early to start panicking, alot of teams lose two in a row, but the goaltending has really suffered.  I have never had the confidence in Gustaffson, and really I would think of getting rid of the guy.  He just has never proven himself,  IMO</text>

	<text>It"s just not the goaltending that has suffered...Toronto is now struggling to put them behind the net, too!  It is time to panic.  If you have a winning record early on and want to keep the pace, you have to go out and do something...get another goalie...GUS and gang cannot handle the challenge.</text>

	<text>We"r still in good shape. No need to panic yet. Gus isn"t an all-star, but he"s better than he played last night. Scrivens has had exactly, what, 8 periods of play in the NHL? He got shelled by Boston, plain and simple, and his confidence is shot. No big deal. It happens. I"d leave Scrivens on the bench right now. If I"m Wilson, I keep rolling with Gus, and let him force his way through it. He got shelled in the first Boston game, and then came back with several wins. He"ll play better if he starts against St. Louis. The thing is, like it or not, Gus has got to be the guy right now. He"ll bounce back, but the team in front of him has got to be a lot better than they"ve been the last two games. If we lose 2 or 3 more in a row, then I"ll start to worry. GO LEAFS!!!</text>

	<text>@DFlight. Gionta was not suspended as there was no intentional hit and the head was not targeted by Gionta. Gionta was skating between Reimer who was just outside the blue paint & Phaneuf and was pushed into Reimer by Phaneuf. Gionta had his back to Reimer when the contact happened. Dion has 40 lbs on Gionta so does not take much to knock him off his path. I do not like to see anyone get hurt but it could even be argued that it should not have even been goaltender interference.</text>

	<text>Gionta didn"t get a suspension for the same reason Steckel didn"t on Crosby...that was because they were determined not intentional, Gionta appeared to be squeezing sideways between Reimer and the D-man, losing his balance if you will, and Reimer may have been out of his paint? Gionta is too good of a guy to intentionally elbow him in the head.</text>

	<text>This is not about Reimer coming back. The big problem in Toronto is Ron Wilson. He does not know anything about coaching a team. The only reason he"s there is because him and Burke are friends. He should be fired and a new coach brought in to teach these young guys how to play...Wilson has no clue. He bounces the goalies around like they"re balls. Gus should never have been pulled and he should have played against Boston the other night. Wilson kills all goalies confidence in themselves...he"s pure poison for a team.</text>

	<text>I think I like the veteran presence in goal even as a back up, Leafs should have kept Giguere for that reason at a reduced salary look at how well he"s doing as back up with a low salary over in Colorado. I think Burke should get on the phone and acquire a reliable veteran to be the starter until Reimer comes back and serve as back up, Turco is currently a UFA for example. Scrivens is good but he still needs some development, same goes with Rynnas. Keep the Monster until later in the season use him as backup and 3rd stringer and trade him for something; he is probably more better suited as a back up goaltender in a small market where there is hardly any exposure to the media.</text>

	<text>we must be getting spoiled here in Leaf land...for the 1st time this season we have lost 2 games in a row...the Leafs are still getting their chances but their goaltending has been letting them down...it DEFLATES the whole team when the goalie lets in a weak one...Gus should be down with the Marlies to get his confidence up...it was good enough for Reimer and Scrivens, why is he not afforded the same chance to develop.  This team will be just fine...Burke will not wait to long to rectify this problem...as a matter of fact he may be in touch with NYI for nabakov as a stop gap...he is cheap and is only signed for this year...it could be much worse...we could be ottawa or montreal !!</text>

	<text>BIC1 - just cause wilson said it 12 times doesn"t make it so.  But obviously he has you convinced....  Seems even if his elbow hit him it was incidental contact that Reimer initiated, probably why gionta didn"t get suspended...  I figure Reimer injured his neck when he threw his head back trying to sell the call.</text>

	<text>I think Wilson has mishandled the goaltending starts. Scrivens in Columbus was ok. It was a back-to-back game and Gus had played solidly in New Jersey, so you figure Wilson is giving him a rest to get him ready for the Bruins on Sat. Scrivens plays well in Columbus, can even be credited with stealing a win, and now Wilson has 2 confident goalies on his hands. So back home facing the Cup champs, he decides to go with a hunch, roll the dice, take a chance and play Ben again and the rest is history. What was Gus" mindset when he"s told he"s sitting for the number 3 guy against the Bruins? He"s now the back-up to the back-up? I"m sure Gus was looking forward to the chance to redeem himself agains the Bruins but never got the chance. It"s hard to have confidence in yourself when the coach shows he has absolutely none in you.</text>

	<text>@ SeeThat?- FYI- Reimer was in his crease when Gionta pushed him backwards and onto the ice. And how do you know that Gionta"s hit on Reimer wasn"t intentional? It"s an emotional game and players loose their cool in the heat of the moment while playing. Brendan Shanahan is handing out suspensions to players that go head hunting- whether the hit was intentional or not!</text>

	<text>Anyone with any hockey sense whatsoever knew this was going to be a problem before the season even started. Even if Reimer wasn"t hurt a tean can"t just forfeit every game the back-up goaltender starts. I could see it but unfortunately 9 out of 10 Leafs fans love everything wearing a Leaf uniform and are blinded by their bliss for a guy called "the Monster". I"ll say it one more time for anyone who hasn"t read it the first 1000 times I said it, Gustavsson is not an NHL quality goaltender. Burke, get a move on with that trade please, stop nickel and diming the other GM"s while our season slips away.</text>

	<text>That"s probably the perfect argument BIC1 - "Brendan Shanahan is handing out suspensions to players that go head hunting- whether the hit was intentional or not! "  So since shanahan decided not to suspend Gionta - what does that tell you???</text>

	<text>Hey BIC1 Reimere was just out side the crease and Gionta was watching the play and tried to cross in frount of Reimere to disrupt him from making the save and be there for a rebound. That is all that Gionta was doing if Reimere was inside the blue he wouldn"t been hit and there would be nothing said.</text>

	<text>@ Leaf fans - Who would replace Wilson?? The only sure fire possibility that I can see would have been Hitchcock. But that isn"t going to happen. Who"s next? Crawford? Keenan? I say give Willy a chance until Reims comes back and then if the wheels are still off, then he should go. I don"t think I could blame the coach when these two CLEARLY have a chance on becoming a solid backup or maybe even number 1, if Reimer goes back to IR.</text>

I dislike it as much as the next leaf fan but "accidentally" eblowing someone in the head is just uncalled for. Just finish checks on Gionta cleanly with a little extra force. Leave Price alone and show that they have respect for the league.</text>

	<text>To many varriables. Even if you say Wilson is killing thier confidence, Who cares because the Monster just isnt a good goalie. More of a boogie man then a monster. Scrivens is simply not Reimer, and expecting to have 2 young goalies in the system able to just simply jump and and dominate is delusional.

Solution are either wait it out for Reimer, Trade the monster for a card board cut out. I don"t like Wilson but I can"t blame him for not having a goalie he can use, That"s BB"s bad.</text>

	<text>This mess is due to bad coaching.  Scrivens NEVER should have been given that second consecutive start.  The decision to start Scrivens in back to back games basically tells the Monster that they are looking for ANYBODY who has a decent game to replace him.  The Monster was playing well before this!  Not great, but he gave them a chance to win.  Now the Monster"s confidence is shot and to top it off instead of letting his first NHL start soak in for a bit, all Scrivens is thinking about are his last two sub par performances!</text>

Tim thomas did what in the final last year ??? this league relies on good goaltending if not great and if you dont have that you loose plain and simple no amount of coaching is going to make up for bad goals.</text>

	<text>"I thought".........there`s a great quote from Ron Wilson. They should have it embossed in his going away plaque. Reimer isn`t a goal scorer if I remember correctly..we`ve managed 1 goal in 2 games and have had 12 scored on us all the while the Leafs have looked like novices chasing the puck all over the ice. The PP is last, the PK is last-----and if nothing is done as far as Wilson`s job goes, the Leafs are soon to be last.</text>

	<text>Monster can only be a backup goalie that can play possibly 20 to 25 games a year.  If he goes .500, then he"s good.  The Leafs are fairing like any other team would if their number one goalie went down.  Think of MTL without Price.  Teams with a 1 - 2 rather than a 1 - 1A scenario in goal are bound to struggle at times, since their fate relys mostly on the guy between the pipes.  Simply put, they"ll have to fight their way through the next month or so until Reims is ready.</text>

	<text>Good posts about the lack of D in the Toronto system but it is more than that - the Leafs defensive philosophy is NON-EXISTENT!! The reason that Thomas last season and Rask the season before when Thomas was injured led the league in SAV % and GAA each goalie let the NHL in each stat in successive years is because Julien demands that his forwards play defense - one of the big reasons why Fat Phil did not want to play for him. Toronto is the only team in the top 15 with a MINUS goal differential - led by their CAPTAIN who is - 3 in his last 11 games - sorry leaf fans no commitment to defense = no cup.</text>

	<text>tonysnuggz - Bruins #1 goalie Thomas went down in 09-10 and Rask led the league in GAA and SAV% - took them to within an OT goal of the conference finals. Halak was the Habs back-up that same year and when Price did his usual playoff swoon Halak took them to the conference finals.

	<text>How was this last loss on the leafs D. The game I watched they played a pretty good game and limited the scoring chances how many of those goals were actually good goals how many big saves did those goalies make. The PK looked great.. The forwards just got unlucky not because of lack of effort/chances in 39 shots on net. Boston game was bad yes but this game the leafs played well. Wilson fixed a lot of things in their game. Horrible goaltending and you can"t win games without goaltending. Leafs need a number 1 plan and simple. Someone they will have faith in. Leafs played a tight defensive game last night and gus/ben still lets in the bad ones</text>

	<text>The really sad part of this problem is that the Leafs are among the youngest, largest, fastest teams in the league. Their physical game is non-existant. Teams know they aren"t getting hit because the Leafs are afraid to take penalties. This is where the coach comes in with a plan. There is no Wilson plan. Worst coach in the league.</text>

You havemt watched phil, being a self admitted boston fan. Pil commited to defensive hockey at the end of last year. He"s been banging in the corners, and playing d. Which is why he lead the league in +/- up until thee last 3 games or so. Face it, phil just didn"t want to play in boston. Had nothing to do with the system, just the people, son.

That being said, D isn"t the issue. Did you watch the FLA game? The goals weren"t even classified as scoring chances - thatt isn"t bad D, that"s bad goaltending. We"ll see how the fare when reimer comes back. Of course then it"ll bee, oh the leafs always go on a tear in the 2nd half. No, the leafs tear it up when their goalie isn"t on the shelf. And no, they don"t neeed a STAR goalie to win, just a regular goalie that can stop a puck or 2 would be nice.</text>

	<text>It"s been in focus the entire time.  The only difference was that the Leafs offence was covering up for mistakes on weak goals ie. Rangers 1st goal in a 4-2 win.  Bottom line is that they need a goalie that will stop a puck and this guy has obviously proven that he isn"t the answer.  Maybe Nabokov as a short-term fix?  They need something.</text>

	<text>@BIC1 Watch the replay from all angles. Giontas right elbow is in front of him so that one did not touch him. Giona hits him with his butt after being pushed by Phaneuf. Reimer is already pushed backwards when Gionta"s left arm goes by. I do not think either elbow even made contact.</text>

	<text>Cant say im shocked the leafs have run into goltending issues. Is it really that big of a surprise? "The Monster" is only scary to his own team. Scrivens and Reimer have not proven they are starting goaltenders in the N.H.L. at this point. They are young and maybe they will become the 1 and 1A that every team wants but as of right now they havnt proved anything yet. I hope for the leafs sake they dont get desperate and start trading away future to satisfy the media right now. the only guy that should be moved is Komi. shed some cap  room for signing a top center man. Connelly is glass no surprise he is gonna be hurt all the time .again these are all things that people new where gonna happen! Im not a leafs fan but I dont want to see them loose any more. But rebuilds take time, and if the fans want a cup any time soon let the kids grow and quit jumping on the coach and players and G.m when they lose!</text>

	<text>The fact remains Leaf fans, Reimer is a starter but he will not be able to log heavy minutes each year. He"s a big goalie and from what I have seen last year and the strat of this year he looks tired after a few starts in s row. You need a veteran goalie to back him up. Turco would make a lot of sense right now.</text>

	<text>24 1, don"t be naive. While I don"t think Gionta is the type of goon to deliberately cause something like this, don"t think for a minute he exacted any type of consideration or care around Reimer that he would have for his own goalie. If he was doing the same play in front of Price, he would have been a lot more cautious. It was pretty negligent on his behalf and I frown upon a captain for that.</text>

	<text>Gionta went to the front of the net looking for the rebound, which was there.  Reimer slid up to the top of the crease, and was sliding up and out of it as Gionta was trying to cut across.  At the same time, Plekanec was also looking for the rebound and was being checked by Phaneuf, and it took away the space that was there as Gionta was trying to cut across.  Notice that Phaneuf then cross checked Plekanec in the back, knocking him down, and then looked back at the referee to see if he was being called, but of course, the only penalty on the play was to Gionta for making incidental contact with the goalie out of his crease, not on the blatant cross check on Phaneuf RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE REF.</text>

	<text>@ louguy20..If Burke can trade Lebda and get Lombardi and Franson or trade beauchimin for Lupul and Gardiner then it is not to far fetched he could get the bullin wall should Reimer not be available. I don"t think The Monster in the plans for the leafs. I would of loved to have Turco but really he is a gamble. If they have to sweeten the deal by throwing in Aulie or someone I won"t lose sleep over it. I think Edmonton will want to give there younger goalies more of the reins as the season goes on. Khabibulin stock is up after he has not such a great season last year. Anything is possible if Gretzky can be traded.</text>
