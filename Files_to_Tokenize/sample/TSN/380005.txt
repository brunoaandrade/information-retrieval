	<text>Brendan Taman will be staying on as general manager of the Saskatchewan Roughriders and was given control of the football operations of the club on Wednesday.The retirement of Ken Miller left a void in the Roughriders' front office, making the general manager the top decision-maker in the organization. Former offensive lineman Jeremy O'Day was promoted to the position of assistant general manager on Wednesday to assist Taman in his duties. O'Day originally joined the Riders front office as the team's football operations coordinator earlier this year.&quot;Jeremy has surpassed our expectations in the job he has done for us,&quot; said Taman. &quot;He brings forth incredible dedication and passion to this job and he knows the importance of the Riders to this community. He has an outstanding relationship with the players and has proved very proficient on the player personnel side of the business.&quot;During his playing days, O'Day was named a divisional all-star six times and a CFL all-star three times. He was also the Riders nominee for Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman in four seasons.&nbsp;&quot;I am extremely thankful to Brendan and President/CEO Jim Hopson for giving me this opportunity,&quot; stated O'Day. &quot;Continuing my career with this organization after 12 great years of playing has been a dream come true. I look forward to the challenges ahead of getting this team back on top.&quot;Miller was the vice-president of football operations before adding head coach to his list of duties when Greg Marshall was midway through the season. Miller announced his plans to retire prior to the last game of the season.Craig Smith was named the director of player personel.Taman joined the Roughriders for the 2009 season and then took over as general manager when Eric Tillman resigned after the season. The team later named Miller the vice-president of football operations and gave him the final say on all decisions.&nbsp;</text>

	<text>I know that this is going to cause a lot of anguish in Sask, as Taman is pretty much on par with the devil, but with all decisions going through Miller where does the buck really stop?  I think we got a glimpse of some of the questionable moves Miller made at the end of the season, ie: Clermont at WR???  Bergquist getting no playing time.  Taking the kick-off at the end of the last game.  I wonder if Millers belief in his men caused him to overlook some glaring deficiencies.  I say we give Taman one year as top-decision maker then cut him loose if we don"t make the play-offs again.</text>

	<text>I think the Riders learn a big lesson from firing Marshall too soon without giving him a proper chance to find success for the team. With Miller totally out the picture and Taman officially at the helm hopefully this will allow the organization to make some big moves this upcoming season of rebuilding.
Go Bombers.</text>

	<text>In Winnipeg, Taman found talent, period. That they under-performed is hardly his fault. Giving him full reins for the Riders will et people know within 2 seasons whether or not this is a good idea. I think the Riders" most important hire will be head coach, and unfortunately, the best candidate for that has already been fired by Miller. He"s got a lot of cleaning up to do. The Riders will stink next year, but look for a big comeback the year after, due to Taman"s scouting.</text>

	<text>As a Riders fan of many years, I"m interested to see how this will go. In my opinion, they had a completely unworkable management structure for the past 2 years! In this case he now can hire his own head coach. He also has the ability to built his team.I know many fans wanted Brendan fired, but I don"t believe he can be held accountable for last season. I feel the blame falls on Ken Millers shoulders, and while he was liked by the players and is a decent human being, I don"t think he had the savy to find players, to judge talent. I also believe he was to stuck on loyalty even when performance was lacking. Any how, it will be intersting to see how this moves forward!</text>

	<text>As the GM he shouldn"t have had Miller looking over his shoulder and making the final decisions. Taman may not be the right guy for the Riders, but he deserves a chance to build a roster without Miller having final say; you know, like every other GM in the CFL. If he fails as the head honcho then by all means fire the guy. Miller was a very good coach, but the epic fail of the Riders this year hangs solely on him in my opinion. He had final say on personnel moves, he hired Marshall as his personal successor and then failed to stay out of the way before canning him essentially a cave to the pressure of the fans as best as I can tell. Let Taman hire the coaches he wants, let him make the roster moves, give him 2 or 3 years. Sure, he had a losing record in Winnipeg, but he built the Bomber team that lost the Grey Cup by only 4 points with a backup QB making his first career start. The real question for Rider fans is who else are you going to get? Have you noticed how recycled this league is? Find another guy with the credentials to be a GM in this league right now; and don"t say Kent Austin, he"s not coming back!</text>

	<text>I can"t believe people putting all the blame for last year on Taman.  He hasn"t been with the team long enough to have had that kind of a negative impact.  In fact he wasn"t even the guy in charge, in reality, Ken Miller was.  But hey, none of you so called Rider fans have ever let fact stand  in the way of your own fictionalized ideas of what"s happening with this team.</text>

	<text>Riders were on a slippery slope this past season. They have now made a HUGE decision. It will no longer be a slope. It will be a clear path sliding straight down and remaining at the bottom of an 8 team league. I guess History always repeats itself. Our History of not making the playoffs for 11 years is about to be re-lived. This man is an uninspired and boring GM. His interviews are really hard to take. He reminds me of Bart Simpson"s teacher; after 30 seconds all you hear is bla, blah, blah blah. I really dislike this decision. In fact I resent it! We have a chance to start from scratch. Instead we are going to have the most important position on the team occupied by the least impressive GM in the League. YUCK!</text>

	<text>Thank You Jim Hopson.  You just saved me about $400.  I will not be a season ticket holder in 2012.  This is totally parallel to Danny Machocia in Edmonton.  OK, Taman never had the final say.  But is it a coincidence that we got a bunch of Bomber rejects since he has arrived, I don"t think so.  Taman had more say than many want to believe.</text>

	<text>I"m not surprised they kept Taman not happy but not surprised but I expected him to be moved to more admin and hire a new GM. He does have some success drafting Butler and Milo when others would have passed but the overall talent on the field he finds is far below the standard set by others like Buono and Tillman. With the nature of the CFL the GM"s pipeline is just as critical to success as having a strong Canadian core.</text>

	<text>OMG!!! this guy must be related to the prez Jim Hopson!!! What does he do to deserve the promotion and probably more pay!!! He did NOTHING to improve the team..as matter of fact, the team took the turn for worst after he took over. I see him as just a fill-in for Tillman when he resigned. While Rider fans are calling for new GM, the team is giving him MORE responsibility? I guess it is true that the Riders are making too much money and they don"t care if they lose fan base?? They should put the money into good use - like giving lucrative deal the great GM or scout!! This is very disappointing for Rider Nations....I can see the team will stink for few more years...</text>

We Rider fansdidn"t treat you guys like this after last season.  We showed some class and were hoping for more parity this year.  You guys seem to love seeing other teams fail because it helps ease the pain of living where you do.</text>

	<text>Expect one of the quarterbacks the Bombers now have signed showing up at Riders camp next spring.

Elliot?  Brink?  Pierce?  Goltz? 

I think any one of the 4 would be a good addition.  And if you can get either Brink or Elliot you would have yourself a really good quarterback with potential to be a starter for a few years.  

How would Andy Fantuz look in Blue and Gold?   

That"s fair isn"t it - a top rate Canadian for a quarterback who could be a starting quarterback, or at the very least a damn good backup, for years to come?</text>

I would like to to see all 8 teams flourish. Imagine an entertaining, competitive and financially viable CFL. A league that would feel confident to expand. I could go on...

Man whats Al Ford doing you couldn"t have made a worse choice Jim but now you are on the chopping block too, Roger Branvold get control of this before we are back to the late 70"s early 80"s as a footbal club.</text>

	<text>Why is everyone putting the blame on Taman. It is widely known that Ken Miller was the person in charge of all player personel and coaching personel decisions. He is the one that hired and fired Marshall and Berry, and he is the one that didn"t find the bodies the team needed. Taman was not a part of that.</text>

	<text>It appears the problems with the Riders start at the top. After a brutal season where we finished 0-10 against west rivals we are endorsing our GM with a new contract. Defensive ends were missing for 2 years but now this GM suddenly has all the answers if you read newspaper articles. Also always much fanfare about second place finishs in Grey Cups where the opportunity was squandered merits praise. 3 Grey Cups in 100 years in an 8 team league where only 2 teams do not make the playoffs explains a lot about our management. Now they are going to put a patch on an old tire againextending Tamans contractas that is their MO. New blood and younger people with vision for the future are required at the topupper mangementand that comment is coming from an old guy that cares about his team. I am tired of listening to their excuses and lack of action. With that kind of attitude and accountability at the top it will always be next year country around here.</text>

	<text>Of the 21 years Taman has been in the League he has found 6 solid players. Thats 1 good player every 3 and a half years. The Riders will be hosting the Grey Cup in 2013. So that means Taman will have found you 1 and a half good players by then. I remember flamboyant Coach Mike Kelly stating that Taman has absolutley zero contacts South of the Border. He also went on to state that Taman"s preperations before an out of office meeting was brutal. So much so that Taman would actually use a napkin in the meetings to write down any possible contacts or leads. What in the heck is Hopkins doing to you Rider fans and your beloved team? I guess he is following suite to what has happened to the team this season. From top to bottom in the orginization you go from 1st to worst!</text>

No one can honestly believe all your ranting and raving on here are taken into consideration let alone even read by the top brass.
And now bottom line is either Taman produces or he is indeed the problem and not everyone around him as much as opposing fans think.

As a long time Bomber fan, I can"t say that I was pleased with Taman but he certainly did more for the Bombers than Kelly did. And as an evaluator of talent, Kelly has no grounds to criticize any one. He actually thought LeFors was a good QB! He believed it so much that it forced us to cut Glenn who while not great is at least serviceable as a starter, instead of possibly trading him for something. Kelly"s word is not permitted as evidence of Taman"s abilities!!</text>

	<text>I really do not see what the Riders see in Taman. With all due respect the guy has not done anything of significance in the CFL yet- as he has yet to architect a Championship team in any way. Taman inherited a team that was solid for 2010 and when he began making moves the team suffered this year. Taman had a record of 39-50-1 with the Bombers what makes the Riders think he can run this team effectively. If just anyone can run a team- I would like to have a shot at GM of the Riders.</text>

We"ll also see how smart he is at keeping his own players because this needs has plenty of holes to fill.  

I"m waiting patiently when this all starts to happen because right now, he"s on easy street, come the new year, his butt is on the line.</text>

	<text>baritonick, where do see all this talent that Taman brote into wpg? Seriously? Wow. He ran alongside Dave Ritchie when he arrived in 1999 by trading picks for aging veterans who had a couple good yrs left. Wpg improved to 14-4 in 2001, but look at that roster. They were all cfl veterans and by 2002 that franchise was on the decline and has not recovered fully yet. Joe Mack began building with Canadians just like Buono and Tillman have done for years. Taman did nothing when he was here in the 90"s along with Ford, then in Wpg they never had real success, and in 2 years back in Regina, He has successfully destroyed what Tillman and Austin started...well I guess that means He was successful at something. What a horrible decision by Mr.Hobson.</text>

	<text>I haved mixed feelings about this, but am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt....for now see who he hires for a Head Coach. The thing I appreciate about the organization now compared to in the past, is that it isn"t afraid or hesitant to act qickly on something that is wrong now, rather than later,  since the structure was changed a number of years ago when we decided to have a CEO at this time Jim Hopson in place to oversee all aspects of the organization. In other words we aren"t as accepting of mediocrity as we once were. Danny Barrett, as great a guy as he was, should have been relieved of his duties sooner than he was, but Shivers, who was in complete control at the time, wouldn"t let his guy go. Thus 9-9 seasons were the norm. Although some didn"t agree with the firing of Marshall, I agreed with it because to me it showed that we weren"t going to put up with mediocrity. In the past, because he was a nice guy, and it was his first job, we wouldn"t have done anything to change things.We would have kept him on for Lord knows how long. So let"s see who they hire for a Head Coach and go from there. I just hope it"s someone young, like a Dave Dickenson, and not an old retread like Marshall. Also glad they got rid of the VP of Football Operations position and we now have a real GM position in place as it was before creating the VP position to keep Miller around.</text>

	<text>The confirmation of Brandon Tamen as GM and giving him full control of the football operation will guarantee that  Saskatchewan will finish last in the west again next year.
The only good news in all of this for Sasketchewan fans is the hiring of O"Day as assistant GM. This will be the only good decision that Taman makes over the next year from a football stand point; unless of course Taman is able to pry Dave Dickenson out of Calgary to be Saskatchewan"s next head coach.
I would like to see Dave in BC next year when Wally kicks himself upstairs to focus on doing General Manager duties. If dave is hired as the next Saskatchewan head coach it looks like Mike Benevites will be the next Lions head coach. Mike deserves the promotion given the great job he has done in coaching the defence over the years; plus he"s a young coach and knows all of the players and the winning system that Wally has put into place while coaching BC.</text>

	<text>Half of the B.S. you people post is uninformed Garbage! Let play out the situation ... Ken Miller was HC in 2009 & we lost the grey Cup, he was the HC in 2010 and we lost the grey cup. Then in 2011 he was appointed VP of Operations ... that means EVERYONE reports to him including Taman.  Taman didn"t want to hire Greg Marhsall but Miller did anyways.  Taman brought a whole slough of tallent in but Miller made excuses not to use them.  So I think it is only fair to give him a chance, besides to can"t restructure the front office at this point in the season, all of the good coaching tallent will be gone and the season will be lost again.  We have gotten rid of the common variable that couldn"t deliver on back-to-back Rider Grey Cups.  Time to let some else try for a change.</text>

Taman brought in a whole slough of talent!  Are you kidding me?  As a Rider fan i"m looking forward to another year of the same next season!  Is anyone surprised by Taman running the Riders into the ground?  All you have to do is look at the Blue Bombers that made the Grey Cup in 2007 and then Taman ran them into the ground for the next 3 years and this season they are finally coming out of it!</text>

Every team in the CFL knows the Riders were no threat running the ball so keyed in on the pass attack.</text>

	<text>Taman"s deserves a shot to have full control without some old guy putting a stamp of approval on every deal he tries to make.  Let"s see what he can do next year.  If the team shows some progress with a couple more wins, improved defense and offense, extend him a couple more seasons.  If they play similar to this season, part ways.  Guy deserves a chance.</text>

	<text>Tbear2...actually, Tristan had great numbers and performed very well this year as a DB in coverage.  I wasn"t a big fan when he got here but he did impress me as the year went on.  As a return man, well, let"s keep him for his DB skills.  Every DB in the league gets burned once in a while with a big play, but he had very few against him this year, and he made some great knock downs.  And other teams of course has their tallest wide receivers against him too.  As for Romero, I agree with you.....ship him out!!  As for Taman, yes he brought in Butler, Tristan, Milo and this new Rowe kid looks great so far on the line.  But he has also shown to bring in re-treads in the past.  I say we give him one year at the controls and see what he does.  If he can get a good young coach and a QB coach to work with DD, along with a DE or two and some younger o-lineman, perhaps he"ll earn his keep.  If not, ship him out next season.</text>

	<text>Those that say Taman never had a fair crack at doing his job are only proving why he must go.  If those in the head office did not have faith that he can do a good job and have to oversee every move he makes.  That indicates he would not do any better on his own, this was proven in Winnipeg.  Why do think it is any different now?  When they hired Marshal, Miller thanked Taman for all his hard work booking hotels and flights.  Taman is a glorified administrative assistant.  If Taman truly has the ability to be a good GM he would not have stood for others doing his job.  He would have fought to make the moves he wanted as that those decisions fall on his head not others.  So either he can"t do his job because he does not have the skills required or he does not have the gumption to do it.  Any way you cut it, it is not that difficult of a decision, should have sent him packing.</text>

He also made the poor decision to stay with the old guysCates,Simpson part of O line when they had alot of new players brought in Yvenson Bernard,Brandon West, Freddie Barnes, Berquist and more.
The Riders had 4 games to try the newer players but Miller made a terrible decision not to. Good decision to let Taman have one more year as the top guy this time and see what he can do.</text>

	<text>If Taman hires the right head coach, I"m confident things are going to get a whole lot better. People can criticize him all they want for his choices of coaches in Winnipeg, but have so many forgotten Tillman"s experiment with Joe Paopao in Ottawa? All the talent on that team that went on to have success with other teams that they never realized with the Renegades. Eric learned from that and returned to hiring better coaches. I"m sure Taman"s experience has helped him become a little better at knowing what to look for in a head coach. I think his idea to hire Milanovich would have been a good decision for the team. Unfortunately Ken wanted a coach that would show loyalty to the players and coaches he loved, so that didn"t happen. We"ll see who"s available this time around. That one decision is going to decide next season more-so than any roster changes that are upcoming.</text>

	<text>Taman deserves at least one year to show what he can do as a true GM with all the power that goes with the job. Contrary to what some posters have said here, he did bring in talent this year. It was frustrating to see much of that talent languishing on the practice roster, or misused on the field Clermont playing WR; Ephram Hill not playing slot; not trying some of the newer, younger O lineman. These were not decisions of Brendan Taman; they were decisions of the coaching staff. We"ll see Taman"s true value this time next season when the Riders are in the playoffs, or looking on from the sidelines again. The man deserves next season to prove himself in Regina.</text>

right on man!  Bernard is a wicked good back.  Can"t believe you guys never even gave him a shot?!  

who knows for sure, but from the little I saw of him it sure looked to me like he was a guy who could get a ton of yards and block and catch out of the backfield.  highly recommended by Mike Riley.  What more do you want?

cant believe that guy never got one carry this year!  he runs like a pit bull!!

	<text>Taman is a BIG mistake..The Riders are now doomed until Hopson opens his eyes and sees that Taman is not a GM..Hes been gone from Winnipeg for over 3 years and the Bombers are just nicely starting to recover from his poor judgement.The Riders are now destined for a couple of last place finishes.</text>

	<text>Glen Suitor said he would be interested in coaching or Gm. And yes he said coaching for the Rider organization is the best job in N.A Pro sports.He has a great mind for football and the way he talks about how to run a team and his philosophy about the players and the team is exactly is what the Riders need. Big mistake if the Rider brass do not pursue him in some compacity.</text>

	<text>Jeremy Oday is good with the players but that is not our problem. Our problem is many of our players could not play for any other CFL team because their just not CFL calibre players. What we need is someone who actually has contacts down south to feed us players that are worthy of earning a spot on the roster. Oday is just another sweet talker who like Taman can probably crunch numbers but will not help in finding CFL calibre players.He will join Taman as another employee draining the franchise of its resources. It is time the directors take a serious look at Mr. Hopson and whether he is worthy of staying with this team. I will gaurentee you by keeping Taman, the Riders will struggle to have any sellouts next year.</text>

	<text>Next year Taman will say we are rebuilding please be patient.  He had full control in Winnipeg and was a disaster.  As GM in Sask he filled no holes, only attracted over the hill free agents and took at team from the top to the bottom.  This organization is slipping fast and at this point the board responsible for Taman needs to go.</text>

	<text>it always was the o line. on the eskies rider game last week they said the eskimos made 13 different changed throughout the year and we didnt make 1. so maybe coaching goes into that too maybe miller was to buddy buddy with the guys. ive come to the conclusion that your team basically lives and dies with the o line. a bad qb can do alright if he has time where a great qb cant do anything when you have 1 steamboat every time.</text>

	<text>Taman has a bad habit - he"s addicted to aging veterans to fix issues - they cost more and eventually get too old - at which point his loyalty prevents him from letting them go and he re-signs them instead.  He DOES have a knack for finding talented running backs and linebackers but couldn"t find a good quarterback when he needs to at the NFL Pro Bowl!</text>

	<text>Marshall was the right coach,but he didn"t get a chance.
When you have the previous headcoach who was adored by all the players om the team,who the QB thought of as a father figure go out to every practise and stand on the sidelines it is very distracting and not fair.
When you hire a coach,you let him run the show with no distractions.
I know if i was in marshalls situation  i wouldn"t like it.</text>

	<text>Hopefully O"Day can prevent Taman from making his usual bad decisions.  Is it really a surprise that as soon as Tillman left the riders started going down the tube? Then Tillman brings in his usual favourites in Edmonton and they are in the playoffs.  If we do the same next year Hopson and Taman MUST and I repeat MUST go.</text>

	<text>I"m highly skeptical of this decision however I"m going to reserve judgement until we see the product on the field next year with Taman fully in charge. Believe me I"m an unhappy Rider fan after a terrible season but at the same time obviously personnel within this organization believe in Taman so I"ll wait and see till the games are played. I continue to enjoy other teams fans laugh it up about these however in this league there is always a time that will come when the shoe is on the other foot. And for some of you that wasn"t that long ago. IE- Last year other than the Als!</text>

	<text>I don"t see anything that says Taman"s contract has been extended.  He has one more year left on his contract, and if the Rider board was going to fire him, they should have done it at least a month ago, so a new GM could start to evaluate the players for next year, and start contract negotiations with players in their option year.  If the GM is going to hire the head coach, he needs to be recruiting right after the Grey Cup as well.  I"m not a Taman fan, his free agent signings in particular have tended to be busts, but getting the right head coach is more important than improving the player personnel.  The Riders bombed this year because they didn"t play very well as a team, not because their talent level was so low.  Other than Paul McCallum"s kicking, 2011 has not been a great year for outstanding play in the CFL, so I don"t see where other teams are leaving the Riders in the dust.</text>

	<text>I think Taman"s interview, as well as Greg Marshall"s, "No comment," when asked about Miller"s presence tell you all you need to know. Like Taman said, "If we bring a guy in and he"s not playing, I need to know why." A GM doesn"t set the rosters and appoint the starters, he signs players. He trades and releases players at the request of his coaches, he doesn"t just up and turf them. The good news is that Taman didn"t start trading away our future that should have been our present that instead sat on the practice roster all season long. The next head coach has a lot of talent to choose from, and will hopefully make better decisions about who stays and who goes, who plays and who sits.</text>

Miller had his finger on the red button for the last couple years and I for one want to see how the Riders can do without his management.</text>

	<text>I have yet to see any good arguments as to why Taman isn"t a good fit.  All I see is that he is to blame for the losing season.  But that is not a reason.  At least in Edmonton, we could say that Danny Machoka, didn"t bring in more good talent and as a coach didn"t use his talent to his full advantage example, sending out Ed Hervey 5-7 yards out when he was so speedy.  I don"t mind calling Taman into question, but I"m not a Rider fan and I don"t know why he"s so bad for the team.  Somebody put out some concrete reasons.</text>

	<text>I am a big Rider fan.  I suppose Taman deserves a fair shot.  Lets give him a chance then we can run him out of town.  Let"s keep chasing him West like Winnipeg did. I for one know he is not a football guru or talent finder. Probably doesn"t know what a screen pass is.  I know if many of us started as the assistant of an assistant GM, in a few years we all could be better than Taman.  I bet if you throw a football to him he would turn, close his eyes and step away.  He looks like he should be managing a KFC.</text>

	<text>I think this is a good move, not in terms of the team, but to give Taman a chance to put up or shut up. If Taman was let go now, he could easily say that the weird structure of Miller HC and VP handcuffed him, i.e. in a traditional team structure, his sub-ordinate was also his boss.

If Taman doesn"t deliver, he has no one else to blame, and we can just not renew his contract and say Thanks for all the fish</text>

	<text>Chinbopper, the concrete reason is that there are some fans who will never be impressed by anything that any GM, head coach, or quarterback will do. Even after the Riders won the Grey Cup in 2007, I remember people talking about how Tillman was a horrible GM, it was a fluke he and Austin won with Shivers" players because they didn"t bring anything new to the table. Unfortunately this is why I can"t stand listening to some people. Working in management myself, it was clear for me to see Taman was handcuffed and has been his entire tenure to this point. I can"t say he"s some messiah that"s going to save us, but he certainly hadn"t been given the opportunity to do much. The things he gets criticized for that actually are his job are virtually baseless. Doug Brown, Craig Butler, and Chris Milo tell me he can find Canadian talent, and Geroy Simon and Milt Stegall tell me he can find American talent. Barrin Simpson may be at the end of his career, but he wasn"t that bad of a free agent aquisition. The things he gets blamed for that are legitimate were not his responsibility. He didn"t make the decision to keep playing Gauthier, or any of the other guys that weren"t performing well enough. People who don"t understand the chain of command, how it was and the way it"s supposed to be, are the ones who are going to blame him for what"s happened. When he does something he can be blamed for, I"ll say something too. But for now, it"s virtually impossible to find fault in what he"s done, because I see a lot of good players on that roster who didn"t have the leadership they truly needed. I"m not saying Ken didn"t have football smarts, but he didn"t have what it took to make the right decisions at the right times about a lot of the management issues he had control over.</text>

	<text>Okay maybe Taman isn"t to blame for the Bomber downfall,which could be true,because remember who was coaching, the one play coach,he has brought in a few surprise talents.I am a Miller fan because his team orientation but as a coach who is too sympathetic to players.As a football mind he wasn"t our best asset,when DD was playing poor he never once pulled him,which is a big mistake,maybe bring in a coach who can be a tyrannt and still be respected by players and other coaches.</text>

	<text>That_Guy_Him your logic about Taman would have grounds if it were not for the fact that he had full control in Winnipeg.  And yes he was the GM in the peg when many big name players were brought into the CFL, however in most cases Simon, Bruce, Chris Williams etc he never recognized the level of talent they were and moved them on for nobodies.  All GM"s have a pool of players to draft or pick from and anyone can recognize some level of talent, a good GM needs to be able to know when to move on aging higher salaries and how to recognize talent that fits the team and fill the wholes.  To recognize how good a player is, Taman has showed no sign of this to this date.</text>

	<text>I agree that Taman should have the remaining year in his contract to show he is a good GM, he doesn"t have any excuses left and the Riders can"t be worse next season.  But if you want to know why knowledgeable Rider fans are negative on him, here is my list.  He signed Dinwiddie, Dorsey, Rodriguez and Romero who have been major busts.  I think there is another veteran bust that I"m forgetting about too. It"s one thing to make a mistake on unproven rookies, but Barrin Simpson was Taman"s best veteran signing, and that was a gift from Mike Kelly"s temperament. Taman wasn"t able to sign either Stevie Baggs or Rey Williams when they didn"t make the NFL.  I think it looks suspicious that Doug Berry came to Regina to replace LaPolice shortly after Taman arrived. Mullinder might not play football next year, so trading him for Baker is better than nothing, but Tad Kornegay was released for nothing in return, and Kornegay is contributing to the Lions going to the Grey Cup.  Taman was brought to Regina in 2009 to negotiate contracts and manage the salary cap, so Ken Miller could coach while Tillman was on "leave". Joe Womack was still there to find players.  Now Womack and Miller are gone, so Taman can"t drop hints that his superior judgment was overruled whenever the front office screws up.  Taman may not be the worst GM in the league, but as far as I"m concerned the Riders deserve to have the best, so he better improve significantly over the next year.</text>

	<text>Unsound business decision to keep Taman around.
You"re 5-13 because management philosophy was to stack up with old, discarded players and management.

Everyone knows this is Taman"s mantra as a GM, just look at his recycled vs newbie recruits ratio.

The organization is ok with this too, just look at how old the coaching staff, and geriatric o-line was to start last season.

Sadly, the Riders really good talent has chosen not to resign with the Taman regime and we"ve ended up being a sad sack farm team for the CFL. How ironic is the "farm" part of that?

	<text>Well I guess O"Day is being trained as the next GM which is fine with me.  He knows football and is well liked and now he has a year or two to make some connections and the in"s and out"s of the GM position.  This is basically we are firing Taman after he teaches O"Day how to do the job.  Taman dropped a lot of vets yes but did so to oppen up cap room to sign Fantuz and offer some decent money to  aquire a D-lineman or 2.  He has a year to prove himself and I personally don"t think he"ll succeed even though I am hoping we do better next year I am not counting on it.</text>

	<text>Keeping Taman is not only a bad decision but raises serious doubts about Hopsons ability to build an organization. We cannot be successful with a team of Bomber cast offs. If nothing else Taman has proven he has no ability to bring the talent required to compete in the CFL. Mr Hopson give your head a shake.</text>

	<text>Seriously people if you don"t like the decision then stop supporting the Riders through ticket sales and outlandish merchandise sales. For us as fans, it"s just a game, a sport for us to enjoy and watch. Shut up and support the team! Obviously the Riders are making their business decision inregardless of what the masses in Riderville think. Taman is not going anywhere for at least a year now, just hope for the best and cheer for the green and white. And for the record, I am not a fan of Taman, but I am a fan of the Riders and football in general so choose to support and cheer for them no matter how bad some of their business decisions may be. If we can"t control it, why get so upset by it?? It"s just football.</text>

	<text>slowandshaky, this is where I call to question the wisdom of "knowledgable" Rider fans. Yes, Taman SIGNED Dinwiddie, Dorsey, Rodriguez, and Romero. Jim Popp also SIGNED Rodriguez, Nealon Greene, and Ahman Green. What"s the difference? Taman had a coach that wouldn"t cut players when the time was right, and Popp has had coaches that will make decisions like that. Just because the players are signed, doesn"t mean that have to make the starting roster. People criticizing Taman don"t understand his job. Like you say, he SIGNED those players. That"s his job. The sooner the coach cuts poor players from the starting roster and tells Taman they aren"t needed on the team, the sooner Taman can trade or release them and find someone else, just like Popp and Tillman do. I agree the Riders deserve the best, but who"s the best? When are we going to get him? And do you honestly believe who you think is the best will get a unanimous stamp of approval in Riderville? I seriously doubt it. Hating Rider GM"s is just a way of life for some people. We could have Jim Popp for GM, Marv Levy as head coach, and Tom Brady at QB and people would still whine that Popp hasn"t replaced Chick and Baggs yet. There is no winning at that position.</text>

	<text>Miller should have stepped down one year ago. Is that right? True fact. He was a great man. Now his time is up.

Who is Durrant? He should be never allowed to meddle with the Management. That"s one of the reasons why Riders failed eventhough they had a great team.

May be they never selected the right HC. There were top candidates available. In fairness to Marshall, the Board never gave him a chance to prove himself.

Trade Durrant and bring in a new QB such as Burris and am sure the Riders will be on the right track. Do what is right or face the consequence of failing again. Will someone stand up and uphold the truth.</text>

	<text>We all want a convenient scapegoat for 2011 but it wasn"t all Taman"s fault.  He deserves his shot to be fully in the driver"s seat but on a short leash.  We need improvement in 2012 and be a contender for the home grey cup game in 2013.  Big test of Taman"s judgement is the HC hire - if he hires Hall -  chances are both he and Taman won"t be around by Nov 2012.</text>

	<text>biff hurley, I agree with you. Taman was hired with the full knowledge of what went on in Winnipeg. He answered to Ken Miller on all player decsions. Miller hired Marshall, not Taman. So, if they did fire him, what message does that send to potential replacements? "We know its not your fault, but we"re gonna fire you anyway". I don"t thik many potential GM"s would want to work under those conditions. He needs to be given a chance to be in charge, and if he blows it, fire him. He should not be fored for someone elses incompetence.</text>

	<text>I can guarantee you one thing -- Ken Miller"s departure is a positive.  I never saw Miller as anything other than someone who benefited greatly from being Kent Austin"s OC.  Eric Tillman elevated Miller to head coach because there was no other viable alternative other than Richie Hall, and we all saw how well Hall did in Edmonton.  With the talent Tillman brought in, the Riders should have been a better ball club than they were under Miller.  I"m somewhat of a believer in continuity so I believe Durant should remain as QB, but there has to be a much better backup to relieve him when necessary.  Their defence needs serious recruiting and overhaul; their offence will be fine if Fantuz, Dressler, Getzlaf and Bagg return.  I"ll measure Taman"s effectiveness on the calibre of defensive players he brings in to play alongside Freeman</text>

	<text>Hmmmm. An O-line that needs rebuilding. The need to find a power running back. A defence with holes that need to be filled. 15 or 16 free agents and no head coach. Put that together with a GM of questionable ability after all wasn"t Taman the one who hired legendary HC greats Doug Berry and Mike Kelly? 
This is not a recipe for success! Sadly, this is a recipe for a team that could go 0-18 in 2012.

	<text>I think as Rider fans we should support our GM and stop complaining.  The decision has been made and it"s something we need to accept.  I don"t know much about Taman"s days in Winnipeg but I do know we made it to the Grey Cup two years in a row under his watch.  Also this year many of the problem with the team could be placed on Miller and his stubborn to devotion to veteran players.  Miller was the one who hired and fired Greg Marshall.  He was also the one who decided to fire and never replace our offensive coordinator.  Taman wanted to bring in Arland Bruce which Miller overturned.  The only pick in the draft that was Miller"s was O"Donnell who didn"t even sign with the team. I also suspect that Miller"s devotion to the vets played a role in not bringing in any defensive ends because we already had Hawkins.  What if we had played Charles and West all year instead of Cates?  The year would have turned out much different if Taman was able to be the sole decision maker.  Let"s see what he can do before we burn our season tickets and craft Taman voodoo dolls.   It will be an exciting 2012 seeing all the new players brought in and our new coaching staff.</text>

	<text>So many people seem to be confident that Taman will find the right coach to lead the riders, but no matter who coaches the team, they will never succeed if he does not bring in the players needed for success. Coach Ditka could not look good with this group of players. When Austin was here players worked harder because they knew another player on practice roster was waiting to take their spot on the roster. This past year, player who constantly messed up had no worries because they knew there was nothing better to replace them.COMPLACENCYS KILLS.</text>

	<text>Tamans inability to find players was no more obvious than when they drafted Butler. Great future but one of our strongest players last year was James Patrick who also plays safety. Why was Patrick not traded for draft picks or defensive prospects. Putting Patrick at linebacker when they have him listed at 175 lbs. is absurd and only proves Tamans inability to replace position players. ITS SO SAD!!!!!!!!!</text>

	<text>Sorry Rider fans who say Taman just quietly did as he was meekly told by Miller. To me it speaks of 2 things. Either 1 Taman really made decisions and is letting Miller take his fall for him or 2 Taman is a weak leader think Tillman, Popp or Buono would let Miller tell them what to do? with very little charisma needed to actually interest or sign players to the CFL or the Riders. Taman has a suitcase of excuses but his lack of recruited talent is a glaring showpiece of what is to come in Riderville. Sorry but I already lived through the Ford years once, I"ll return to the Riders when Taman is gone. Signed, "An Unhappy "So-Called" Community Owner".</text>
