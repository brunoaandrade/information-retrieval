	<text>When NHL free agency opened on July 1, there was a predictable frenzy of activity with players finding new homes and teams trying to sign the parts that might prove to be the groundwork or perhaps the final touch towards a championship run.And now we put the question to you: &quot;Who has been the best or worst of the free agents signed during the off-season?&quot;While many good players re-signed with their teams after becoming free agents, we'll focus on those that switched teams after July 1.WhenJaromir&nbsp;Jagrinked a deal with Philadelphia, the Flyers hoped that the 39-year-old would be able to find some of the form he showed in the NHL before he left for the Kontinental Hockey League. And he's returned with 15 points in his first 14 games to boost a Flyers attack that traded awayMike&nbsp;RichardsandJeff&nbsp;Carterover the summer.Sheldon&nbsp;Souraywas banished to the AHL by the Edmonton Oilers for the 2010-11 campaign. After spending an entire season with the Hershey Bears, Souray was bought out by the Oilers and inked to a one-year deal by the Dallas Stars. Since moving to Dallas, the 35-year-old rearguard has tallied 12 points and has helped lead the Stars to first place in the Pacific Division.Taking a chance on inexpensive goaltending has also paid off for some of the teams that took a chance in the off-season.The Blues'Brian&nbsp;Elliott, Washington'sTomas&nbsp;Vokoun, the Coyotes'Mike&nbsp;Smith,Mathieu&nbsp;Garonof the Lightning and Florida Panthers starterJose&nbsp;Theodoreall signed for under $2 million each and have all exceeded early expectations.The Dallas Stars have also enjoyed great starts from forwardsVernon&nbsp;FiddlerandMichael&nbsp;Ryder.Max Talbot has given an unexpected boost to the Flyers andTomas&nbsp;Fleischmannhas been a positive since joining the Panthers from Colorado.Of course, some of the off-season moves have yet to pay off.The biggest free agent in the pond this summer was forwardBrad&nbsp;Richards, who made a high profile move from Dallas to the New York Rangers. He was expected to drive their offence but the 31-year-old has given New York less than a point per game and has just four goals in 13 contests.When the Buffalo Sabres inkedChristian&nbsp;Ehrhoff, they expected to get the same strong play that he displayed for the Vancouver Canucks. Thus far, Ehrhoff has only one goal and is carrying a minus rating for a Sabres team that is sitting in the middle of the pack in the Eastern Conference.Things are also not going according to plan for the Columbus Blue Jackets and the early play ofJames&nbsp;Wisniewski. After a 51-point season last year for the Islanders and Canadiens, Wisniewski has four points in the Blue Jackets' first six games (after a lengthy suspension) and is a minus-five to start the season. His new team is also dead last in the NHL.The Toronto Maple Leafs were looking for a centre to head up their top line and they thought they had their man in former Sabres forwardTim&nbsp;Connolly. But injuries have again limited Connolly, who has only played more than 70 games in a season only once since 2005, to six games and one goal on the season. He is currently on injured reserve with an upper-body injury.The Carolina Hurricanes have also seenTomas&nbsp;Kaberleslump with just three points to open the year coming off his Stanley Cup victory with the Boston Bruins.So&nbsp;here was Dave's question to you - &quot;Who has been the best or worst of the free agents signed during the off-season?&quot;Here are some of the best responses:&quot;Ville&nbsp;Leinois getting 27 million dollars over the next six years from Buffalo andTim&nbsp;Connollyhas scored more points for Toronto.&quot;- Ben&nbsp;&quot;I have two words for worst free-agent signing--injured reserve. Two more words if you need them:Tim&nbsp;Connolly.&quot;- Zac on Twitter&quot;Three years in the KHL made him three years older, but at 39,Jaromir&nbsp;Jagrhas been an absolute steal for the Flyers.&quot;- Shaun&quot;We knew it in Toronto and they saw it in Boston, so why not in Carolina?Tomas&nbsp;Kaberle's best days are over.&quot;- Al&quot;Marco&nbsp;Sturmwas a great signing by the Canucks because it helped them getDavid&nbsp;Booth.&quot;- Matt on Facebook&quot;If you watch the Rangers, you know thatBrad&nbsp;Richardsis not the answer to this question. He may not be the best signing, but he's far from the worst.&quot;- StephenDave's reply to all:My choice, and we did hear this a lot from others, isSheldon&nbsp;Souray, but the real star of this discussion is the guy who signed him, and five other free agents, and that'sJoe&nbsp;Nieuwendyk, the general manager of the Dallas Stars who just happen to be the NHL's first-place team.Those six free agents came at a total cost of just over 11 million dollars, which is less thanBrad&nbsp;Richards' 12 million--just saying.Souray has been the Dallas Stars' most valuable addition, he is tied for the NHL's plus-minus lead, he is the third highest scoring defencemen, has the booming shot and is a physical and veteran presence on the blue-line, playing 21 minutes a game for 1.65 million dollars.It's a long season, he's 35 and he does get hurt, but so far, Souray is the best free agent for the money that we've seen in the NHL's first month.I scratched out a line about how he could have helped Edmonton.</text>

	<text>He"ll fly under the radar for most people, but Corey Potter has been a really good signing for the Oilers!  It"s early, but he plays 20 minutes, is a plus player and has chipped in some offense.  Not bad for a guy who played only 8 games before this season.</text>

	<text>Jagr will fold like a tent come playoff time when the going gets tough, the leafs took too much of a risk with Connoly, Booth is only one hit from another concussion, but all in all it"s too early to tell.... it takes a while for players to adapt to new players and a new system.</text>

	<text>jags6868 - take away all of Yammy"s secondary assists and where does that leave him?? With 5 goals and 1 assist. EVERY SINGLE ONE of Yammy"s assists were secondary because he hasnt made one nice play to set anyone up all year long. Just one routine pass to Giroux last game was his only descent set-up. Jagr might be skating around out there pretty fast but thats about it. A lot of cherry picking, no back checking, and only gets excited when HE scores. When they start playing the body towards the end of the season and in the playoffs, Yammy will ask to watch from the press box.</text>

	<text>Leino was the worst big money signing.... however with that said if the Red Wings can manage to trade Hudler for Leino.. then Leino should be able to be the offensive player he was in Philadelphia.. and the Red Wings sure need some offence these days. I like the idea of the Leafs signing Turco.... it would be a cheap contract and Turco would enjoy getting a lot of games in until Reimer returns.</text>

	<text>It is way to early to judge these free agent deals, and Erhoff does have 8 assists. When he does get set with the right D partner, and gets to know his teammates, he will be fine. As far as Tim "the Tinman" Connoly, I wouldn"t gave you a bucket of new clipped mullets for his services. Leaf fans deserve much better than him !!</text>

	<text>My comment to Dave was this: why is Wisniewski on the list.  4 points in 6 games puts him on pace for 49 points.  His -5 is more a symptom than a cause for the Blue Jackets problem - 0/8 without him, 2/6 with him.  Yes, he didn"t become the automatic answer and there are areas where he could be better, but to suggest that he"s even a candidate for worst signing is ridiculous.</text>

	<text>Loved Sheldon Souray when he was in Edmonton.  I wish that they could have worked it out but I"m glad to see he"s doing well in Dallas.  I thought he would be a bust there but so far, so good.</text>

	<text>Is Brian Burke a genius? Imagine instead of signing Tim Connolly he spent that money on say Mike Smith, Shane O"Brien and Steve Sullivan?</text>

	<text>I"m not sure why people are saying Connolly is the worst signing... he has 4pts 1,3 in 6 games. Not the best, but then he"s only played 6 games. Yes we knew he was injury prone, however the Leafs need a #1 center, and Connolly has the talent to try and fill that need. For the same cap hit, Leino has 3 pts in 15 games... I"d take an injured Connolly over that. On the flip side, Leino could and likely will eventually pick his game up... Connolly will still be injury prone...</text>

	<text>Nah Connolly isn"t that bad... yeah hes missing alot of games, but its a short-term risk. A little over 4 million for this year and next... not a big deal if he busts. Souray looking like the best, Leino definitely the worst.</text>

	<text>Wellwood is not a gamer.  Good on Winnipeg for understanding how he fits well into that team for now but Wellwood is not a guy that"s gonna make a difference.  Joe Newindyk has done a great job with that stars.  Ryder and Souray looking good early on....see what happens...</text>

	<text>Brad Richards is doing just fine.  10 points in 14 games is not a disappointment, and he is doing his job... his stats are not as high because Dubi is ice cold right now.  Dubi should be scoring and pumping up his assists.  Richards should only score 20-25 goals. Also when that line gets clicking, it will give the Rangers a very powerful 2nd line, which is much more than we had in mind when signing Richards.</text>

	<text>Kaberle should go play in the KHL.  He might do better there.  Carolina is going nowhere.  Boston went all the way last year but really he was a non factor. He has done nothing since he left the Leafs.</text>

	<text>Brad Richards is doing just fine. He"s right on target for his career average prorated for 14 games, the average is 3.99; he has 4 and his assists are just a smidge off 8.9 versus current 6. If expectations are higher than that for him, well then, shame on you for looking at the salary and not at the player.</text>

	<text>Camponi should not be considered the worst UFA signing.Firstly he is not a high profile player, he was a depth defenceman to help out a Young defenive group. His Salary is not high.  Obvious, whoever said this is a habs hater and not a logical person. My pick for best signing at this point in the season is Souray. His production is great for the dollar value. Worst signing, well at this point if Markov was not considered a resign by the habs I would say he is the worst.  However, to me Kaberla or Connelly rank right up there as the worst becuase they were counted on to really help their teams and so far, one is a bust and the other cannot stay healthy and has a history of injuries so to me that is what makes his signing the worst.</text>

	<text>2010 hell ya....really
1- Markov has played his entire career in motreal and has never been a free agent signing

2 Markov has been mostly healthy over his time with the habs,,,this last knee injury run is the only major time he has missed

so Im guessing you must be a leafs fans</text>
