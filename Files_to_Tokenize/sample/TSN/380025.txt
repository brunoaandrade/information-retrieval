	<text>Got a question on rule clarification, comments on rule enforcements or some memorable NHL stories? Kerry Fraser wants to answer your emails atcmonref@tsn.ca!Kerry, I want to start by saying you were and still are my favourite NHL official of all time!&nbsp;My question is, how does a ref determine where an ensuing faceoff is going to be?&nbsp;Whether it be after a puck has been deflected or deliberately shot out of play, an icing, a penalty or any other situation that calls for a puck drop afterwards. My guess is this, after a penalty it goes to the closest point from where the altercation took place, icing, obviously I know its on the opposite end of the ice, but how it's determined what side of the goalie I don't know. Any answers you can give me would be awesome!&nbsp;Terry RobsonTerry: Thank you very much for the selection as your 'All-time favourite NHL official.' I am deeply honoured and wish that I could say you are part of the vast majority. The vote is still being tabulated!Face-off wins, especially in the end zone, mean puck possession. The winner goes on the attack while the loser begins chasing the puck and defending. Much attention to detail is given this highly specialized skill as many goals result directly off a face-off win.As such, lobbying can result from center men in an attempt to have the puck dropped on their 'strong side.'&nbsp; The linesmen follow the protocol established in the rules to determine face-off location but also have some latitude in this regard. From that point it's the luck of the draw.While Rule 76.2 outlines in general terms the face-off location for various stoppages (on one of the nine face-off spots located on the rink) the best rule of thumb is where it states, 'When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be faced-off at a face-off spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played.' Reference is consistently made throughout the rule that, 'the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot' relative to the side where the stoppage occurs.&nbsp;Here's a twist in the rule that might surprise you; 'When it is unclear as to which of the four face-off spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the home team the greatest territorial advantage in the neutral zone will be selected for the ensuing face-off.'If two rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (ie. High-sticking the puck and intentional off-side), the ensuing face-off location shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of territorial advantage to the offending team. The intentional off-side would therefore cause the face-off to result on one of the end spots of that offending team.So Terry, lets follow some of this logic and apply it to end zone face-off location. In Tuesday night's Oilers-Canadiens game, let's assume that one of three Hab players with a team/game leading five shots on goal (P.K.&nbsp;Subban,Erik&nbsp;Coleor Max Pacoriety - so great to see him come back strong!) fires one from the right side ofNikolai&nbsp;Khabibulin.The 'Bulin Wall' (who got the win despite being outshot 29-14) sticks out his glove and in making the save deflects the puck over the opposite side glass and into the mess netting. The resulting face-off would be from the side that the shot was taken (If the puck was caught and frozen the location of the face-off would still be from the side the shot was taken).Let's take this same play one step further.P.K.&nbsp;Subbanshoots the puck from the point and his shot misses the net wide to the opposite side of the shot. The puck then hits Oiler defencemanLadislav&nbsp;Smidand deflects out of play. The resulting face-off would be on the side of the net where the puck deflected off Smid and not from the side the shot was taken (Nearest face-off spot relative to the side where the stoppage occurs).The linesmen are allowed latitude when the puck is frozen in and around the goal crease as to which side of the net the resulting face-off will occur. Location of the initial shot or the side of the crease that the puck ultimately was frozen in a scramble can be the determining factor.Patrick&nbsp;Roywas one goalkeeper that, whenever possible, attempted to dictate on which side the face-off would occur by smothering the puck on the centre's strong side to kill play. If the shot was taken from the side he knew there was the least desired relative to percentage of wins for his centres, Patrick would catch the puck and slide to the opposite side of the crease when pressured and kill the play from that location. Sometimes he gained the advantage he desired.If the linesman has a clear option as to locating the face-off on one side or the other you can bet if one of the centremen has been a 'problem child' on face-offs to that point in the game that player is going on his backhand or weak side to take the draw!In the one referee system, when the stoppage occurred in the middle of the rink or there was an option available, I preferred the puck to be dropped on the same side as the players benches so that my pursuit of play (and vision) wasn't impeded by player line changes on the fly. In the two referee system we see today that option makes no difference.Neutral zone face-offs really don't get players too bent out of shape as to where or how the face-off is conducted.&nbsp; One example of this occurred in Pittsburgh one night when I dropped the puck at center ice following the scoring of a goal.Mario&nbsp;Lemieux, with hands like a surgeon, lined up for the face-off.&nbsp;I asked both centres to place their sticks on the ice, please (a polite term that I always used to solicit player cooperation and was never rejected).&nbsp; As I dropped the puck Mario turned and raised his stick blade off the ice and picked the puck out of the air a foot off the ice. I blew the whistle to conduct the face-off again as the opposing center looked on with a dumbfounded look.I said to Mario, &quot;I bet you can't do that again.&quot; Since I held control of the puck and the element of surprise of the drop, I didn't think there was any way Mario could beat me again on the draw.&nbsp; I planned to slam the puck down so hard he wouldn't be able to get his stick off the ice. Mario just grinned as the challenge was extended.I fired that disk down like a missile and sure enough, 'Super Mario' picked it out of the air before it struck the Igloo centre ice spot. I allowed play to continue through this center ice face-off victory at the lightning reflexes and soft hands ofMario&nbsp;Lemieux.I was mesmerized (like so many others) at the skill of this superstar's hands. I even found myself thinking if I ever needed open heart surgery I would want the knife in Mario's hands.&nbsp;That thought was quickly erased the night he attacked me from the penalty box on April 5, 1994. In that moment I would have been better off if the knife had been in former Pens enforcer Gary Rissling's plumber hands!&nbsp;'Riz' was obviously not a surgeon (but a great guy that knew his role) as he amassed 1,008 penalty minutes in 221 NHL games during his seven-year career. I can't recall seeing 'Riz' ever win a face-off no matter where or how the puck was dropped.Terry, I hope this little detour to center ice didn't detract from the knowledge I hope you have gained on face-off locations but instead gave you a smile for the day.Try and remember gang, it's still a 'kids game' played by 'really big kids!'</text>

	<text>if the game is being played in Calgary...the ref takes his cues from Iggy..based on last nights game..first time I have seen an official take a direct order from a player on a penalty..even when it wasn"t really a penalty..answer that one Fraser!..Refs weren"t going to call anything..then Iginla cries to the official...bang..Flames on a PP..the other officials on ice looked confused..as in why?</text>

	<text>I still like Eric Engels explanation from the team 990 for the Blunden interference/too many men on the ice call. "Blunden hopped on the ice a little too early, and his decision to make a play on the puck made it an automatic too many men on the ice penalty. Once the officials were forced to make that call and it was clear that Blunden was the sixth man, that made him ineligible to throw a hit on the play, hence the interference penalty that gave the Rangers a two-man advantage." This is the correct call.</text>

	<text>C"mon, let up on the person who posed this question. He/she may be new to the game or is a young person in general. As my grade 4 teacher used to bellow at us many a time, ""there"s no such thing as a stupid question.""With that said, I"m not surprised in what Roy did. He was way ahead of many of his peers and was so prepared when it game to game day. Nobody can ever question his work ethic - the sneaky bugger, lol.</text>

	<text>not all fans  have the same knowlege of the game as most mature canadians such as children and some others.I brought a friend from england to watch a game and it was two and a half hours of explaining what was going on It"s the same when my kids watch the games with me. so people don"t knock someone who"s trying to understand and learn the greatest game on earth.</text>

	<text>Another great article to add to a long list. That"s kind of an interesting tidbit about Patrick Roy, it"s just one more reason he was as great a goalie as he was. Same thing for Lemieux. I still think he probably would have been the greatest pure offensive player ever if he had managed a full healthy 20 year career.</text>
