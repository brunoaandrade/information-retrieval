	<text>Seems rich for 3 assists in 14 games. Not saying I"m any good, but I could probably get 3 assists in 14 games on the Flyers...</text>

	<text>Seeing what some defensemen have gone for this offseason this could be considered a pretty good deal. I"d say a slight overpay but at least they got him locked up. Holmgren sure likes to sign guys early before free agency</text>

	<text>Over 4 Mil a season? I appreciate Coburns size and relatively young age, but he has been switched to a shutdown role. He has declining offensive numbers, but that could be just his role changing from 2 way to shutdown defensemen, which fits his size better. Philly may have stole him from Atlanta, but they might be paying him a bit too much now.</text>

	<text>Coburn could and should have been signed for less. He"s been painful to watch this season, as he"s making bad decisions particularly in the offensive zone and become a turnover machine. He hasn"t developed into the top pairing D-man many expected after his breakout season in 2007-08.

Signing Carle--who"s also an UFA after this season--to this deal would have made more sense.</text>

He is a dominate force in the D-zone, he is one of the best skaters in the NHL. $4.5 is a great signing, he one of the top 30 d-men in the league. great signing...and Carle will be signed before the deadline.</text>

	<text>This is a good move. Coburn always struggles during the season but come playoff time this guy is a beast. I think letting Carle go would be good for the team. He has proven he is not very good without Pronger. For his money we need a guy who can handle himself without Pronger holding his hand.</text>

	<text>Overpaid - yeah maybe a little but not much. As a Bs fan Coburn is one of those Dmen that you always have to know when he is on the ice. Big and uses his reach effectively and he sure can hit. He is a solid + player and rarely misses a game. He may turn the puck over a bit but forwards have to think twice about wandering into his side of the ice.</text>

	<text>Yes Coburn can drive you crazy with his decision-making at times, but it"s important to keep in mind that the Flyers have turned him into a shut-down defenseman, from a D-man that used to have more offense in his game.  His minutes are against the top players in the NHL, and used short-handed and even strength.  Keep in mind, Pronger and Kimmo won"t be around forever...I like the deal</text>

	<text>Probably a $4M player, but a $0.5M extra over 4 years isn"t too much. Flyers will have money coming off via Carle this off-season, and a year after that both Hartnell and Timonen who will be 38 will also be off, giving them a lot of room to extend Voracek, Simmonds, and Giroux.</text>

	<text>$4.5 million a season for Coburn? Wow. That is a bit much for an average defenseman. He doesn"t contribute a ton offensively and he is prone to turn overs in his own end. He is not a shut down defensemen. I know a lot of Flyers fans and they call him Slowburn. I think the Flyers over paid, but then again that seems to be happening a lot in the NHL lately</text>

	<text>I know Leafs fans will say he"s no Komisarek, but us Flyers fans like the deal. LOL. Mostly he"s asked to play a defensive role now with Pronger Timonen Carle and Meszaros in the lineup, so his O #"s won"t look gawdy, but he is a good skater and playes solid D. When he"s playing with as snarl and hitting, that"s when he"s at his best. Angry Coburn=best Coburn IMO.</text>

	<text>I don"t mind this deal.  I like Coburn, although he can drive me nuts occasionally.  We stole him from the thrashers.  Coburn is getting better and he"ll have to anchor the defence core when Pronger retires although the flyers could get someone in a couple of years.  I"d love Shea Weber or Ryan Suter on my team but I don"t see it happening.</text>

	<text>Ridiculous!  The Flyers never seem to learn from thier mistakes. Seems to me about 5 years ago they were saying they had the best D in the league and then ran into a major headache trying to stay under the cap cause they paid top dollar to lock up "key" character d-men.  What they ended up doing then was a few lop-sided trades, and a waiver giveaway or 2, just to stay below the cap. The Flyers are becoming the new Rangers.</text>

	<text>Flyers are currently @ 0 cap space with this FANTASTIC deal as their fans are calling it. Can"t wait until next season, b/w the RFAs and UFAs who are they going to sign/ not sign? With these type of contracts not a lot of teams are willing to take on these type of salaries via trade. Flyers aren"t going to have a whole lot of money left to anything especially if they want to keep players like Jagr, Carle. I think it is soemthing like 5 million in total to spend next year?</text>

	<text>A tad high, but not bad overall. However when one looks at their cap space, and current dmen signed, you"d think they"d do things slightly differently. Carle is obviously gone this off season if not before. They just need to get through 1 more year then Timonen"s & Hartnell"s contracts are over. That"ll leave them the space they need to retain RFA"s. But next year will certainly be tight for them.</text>

	<text>As always, people hate what the Flyers do, then turn around and wonder how the Flyers are beating their teams. Remember how they weren"t going to score any goals after trading Carter and Richards? And how you wouldn"t take Jaromir Jagr on your team? Aren"t some of you the same guys who asked those questions?</text>

	<text>i know he"s just entering his prime but still can"t believe he"s worth that kind of money. i remember when Atlanta traded him for Zhitnik and everyone went on and on about how Philly robbed them. while it"s true that Zhitnik"s career was nearly over at the time and Coburn was a great prospect, i think it"s safe to say he never developed into anything beyond a number four or five defenseman. he"s certainly steady but he"s really only had one impressive season and you have to wonder how he"d do on a weaker team.</text>

	<text>well goat6668, he WILL pick it up.  some posters already said it, and i agree with them, that he could easily get a contract around 5 mil on open market.  why are you takling about letang?  he got his contract, and the price was right at that time.  i"m sure the price will be WAY higher than 3.5 mil come his next free agency.</text>

	<text>Wow, a bunch of haters here.  He"s not worth this at all, compare him to this D, and that D.  His point production has gone down.  He"s not an offensive D people, he"s a solid defensive defenseman and he"s very good.  Sure he takes a few too many restraining penalties, but that"s fine.</text>

	<text>It may seem a little high for the first year or two, but in a couple years when Pronger and possibly Kimmo are gone this will be a fair price for what will then probably be a top 2 Dman on the team. Goat, why are you even comparing Letang to Coburn? Two totally different players at different ages. When Letang has next contract at around Coburn"s age he will be getting A TON more than 4.5 mil a year. There have been contracts given out that made less sense.</text>

	<text>I was doing the math and in a years time, this guy gets paid about $175,000 per turnover. Not bad pay for NHL defencemen nowadays. Goat6668 - Letang and its not even close. 3.5 for a probable Norris candidate or 4.5 for a slow defenceman that coughs the puck up with regularity.</text>

	<text>Bad deal/overpaid...whatever the peeps are complaining about...trust me he will not serve his 4 year contract. That"s all bologna when Philly"s Management gives these contracts. the players won"t complete them because they will get traded. Just look at richards. He was the franchise player. Signed a long term deal..then gone. Sad but true</text>

	<text>i love coburn as much as the next guy, but this is a bit pricey. rollover from this summer"s overspending maybe? I"m guessing the Flyers organization is banking on him entering the prime of his career and stepping it up a level. He"s a solid defenseman and I"m glad he"s locked up, just needs to elevate his play to match his salary.</text>

	<text>I notice a lot of comments that talk about his point totals. As a Pens fan, I"ve watched a lot of Flyers games over the last 5+ years. Coburn had a couple of decent/great seasons 07 & 08. However with Pronger and Carle coming to town, he"s lost out on all the top PP minutes he would have had to build on those. Not that I think he"s much of a PP guy, but he has a great shot. However without those minutes he"s turned into more of a shutdown guy. Although him and Timo never really seemed to work as a shutdown tandom as Phily hoped. He does have size, a shot, and can skate. He"s not the best in his own end, but he"s not bad either. I still think the money is a bit high, but they"re not paying him for his points. However if he was given PP time, I think he could put some back up on the board - more in tune with the 07 season. This guy is a #3 or #4 on almost every team in the league. The only difference is that Phily has Prongs, Timo, Carle, Mez and him all vying for top 4 ice time which all deserve.</text>

	<text>goat6668, you can"t compare Letang to Coburn. They"re two completely different players. I think Letang is a better all around player, as well has the hands/vision/shot to play top PP minutes on almost any team in the league. And his price tag will most certainly go up likely 5-6m range in 2 years. Coburn at best is the shooter on the #1 PP however he"s currently behind Mez, Prongs, Timo & Carle. I think if Coburn had the same chances as most young dmen, it"s possible he could have turned into a semi offensive player. However he"s been stuck behind some decent offensive guys, and he"s turned into a defensive guy first.</text>

	<text>Why is everything tied to offensive production, especially for defencemen?  If that were the case then Marc-Andre Bergeron wouldn"t have had to wait until January to find a job last season.  And he definitely would"ve received more than a two-year deal at $1 million per this past summer.</text>
