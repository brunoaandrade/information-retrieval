	<text>NEW YORK, N.Y. - David Stern's deadline passed without a deal, though the NBA and its players will talk again Thursday.The NBA commissioner wouldn't give any hints about what that means for hopes of ending the lockout.&quot;I would not read into this optimism or pessimism,&quot; he said. &quot;We're not failing. We're not succeeding. We're just there.&quot;Players and owners met for more than 12 hours on the 132nd day of the lockout, an important one after Stern warned that if players didn't agree to the league's latest proposal by the end of the business day, a far worse one would be coming.Instead, he &quot;stopped the clock&quot; and said the backup offer would only go into play if this round of bargaining breaks down.As usual, neither side offered many specifics, though union executive director Billy Hunter said the sides never got around to discussing the split of basketball-related income.Besides that, there are still a handful of issues related to the salary cap system that players want addressed before they might agree to the league's demands for a 50-50 split of revenues.&quot;I can't characterize whether they showed flexibility or not in certain system issues,&quot; union presidentDerek&nbsp;Fishersaid. &quot;Obviously, we'd have a deal done if the right flexibility was being shown. The fact that we don't have a deal lets you know that there's still a lot of work to be done on the system.&quot;The parties plan to return at noon Thursday to resume talks.&quot;We can't say there was significant progress today,&quot; Fisher said. &quot;We'll be back tomorrow ... and we'll see if we can continue to make the efforts at least to finish this out.&quot;Stern had set a 5 p.m. ET deadline for players to accept the league's latest proposal or have it replaced by a much harsher one that would drive the sides even farther apart.He said the offer was not pulled at that time because the league was &quot;trying to demonstrate our good faith. Stern added that the understanding was the offer potentially would be pulled at the end of this series of negotiations, whenever that might be.Failure to make a deal likely would increase the calls for the union to decertify so the players can file a lawsuit against the league in court, a risky and lengthy tactic that likely would doom the 2011-12 season. Union officials have downplayed the idea, but players might have no other leverage once the more severe proposal is put into play.The current offer calls for players to receive between 49 per cent and 51 per cent of basketball-related income, though the union said it would be impossible to get above 50.2 per cent. Players were guaranteed 57 per cent of BRI under the previous collective bargaining agreement.Though they called this deal unacceptable, they might not see another one nearly as favourable.The next proposal would call for a 53-47 revenue split in the owners' favour, essentially a hard salary cap and salary rollbacks, which the league originally sought but had taken off the table. Both proposals were sent to Hunter on Sunday.Stern and Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver were joined Wednesday by Spurs owner Peter Holt, the chairman of the labour relations committee, and lawyers Rick Buchanan and Dan Rube. Besides Hunter and Fisher, vice-presidents Roger Mason Jr. andMaurice&nbsp;Evans, economist Kevin Murphy and attorney Jeffrey Kessler represented the union.Kessler took part just hours after saying he regretted telling the Washington Post that owners are treating players like &quot;plantation workers&quot; during the ongoing lockout. He said he planned to call Stern and apologize.Besides the revenue split, the sides still are divided on elements of the salary cap system, mostly relating to the spending rules for teams that are over the luxury tax level. Players want those teams to remain options for free agents, whereas the league thinks talent would be more evenly distributed throughout the league if payrolls were more balanced.Players indicated after their meeting Tuesday that they would be open to reducing their BRI take if owners made some changes on the system issues. Players offered to go to about 51 per cent Saturday, with 1 per cent going into a fund for retired player benefits.But the league has placed as much importance on the system as the split, making it difficult to find compromise on the handful of items that remain unsettled. Owners believe there won't be the competitive balance they desire until payrolls are more equally balanced.A month of games already has been cancelled. Hunter said Tuesday he had heard Stern also planned to cancel games through Christmas without a deal Wednesday, though Stern later told NBA TV that &quot;we have made no such plans, and we have had no such discussions.&quot;</text>

	<text>If they don"t take this deal, they are stupid. They will lose a year, and get an even worse deal shoved down their throats. The NHL players made the same mistake - doubting the owners resolve. They didn"t really believe the owners would scrap a whole year, and were they ever wrong. How the NBAPA hasn"t learned from this is baffling. It"s the owners league, not the players. This will go all year, and PTI will talk hockey a little more everyday, like they are now.</text>

	<text>I think the NBA should dump every player that doesnt want to get on board.  They were offered what, 50% of basketball related profits?  This sport has turned all these ungrateful losers into millionaires, and lets be honest, I think its fair to say a lot of these guys wouldnt be doctors or rocket scientists if they didnt have the gift to play a sport for a living.  If they millions they get paid isnt enough, I"m sure the NBA as a league, would have NO problem recruiting a bunch of young men who would be happy to be paid what they are offering.</text>

Are they going to reduce the prices at their concession stands? No. Why then should we care about a bunch of Millionaire Players & Billionaire Owners that don"t care about their paying public.</text>

	<text>It"s all greed from the players.  They should have to shell out Millions on payroll see how they would like giving up their money on a franchise that struggles.  They want all the cash with no risk.  Somtimes I think all athlete"s are way too spoiled.  They work till about their mid 30"s and are set for life.  It must be tough.</text>

	<text>Attention NBA owners. Im a 6 ft 1 white male, and I play basketball sometimes. I can hit the three pointer quite well. I cant dunk, my passing is ok, I have average stamina. BUT I will play for your team for only $60,000 a year! And I guarantee I will put on an awesome show! maybe not from my game but from theatrics. And youll save millions! To be serious now though, DONT give into the players. The players should be bowing down to the owners, being paid millions to play a game you love.</text>

I think some people just want to see their words on the internet.  Go back to the hockey stories, and leave the people who care about Basketball to ours.  Thanks.</text>

	<text>As far as the Raptors are concerned, I just hope the league doesn"t bend on the system issues. If some of the reports today are true that the league is willing to compromise on the system if the players accept a 50/50 BRI split that couldn"t be worse news for franchises like the Raptors. I"d go so far to say the Raptors need a new SYSTEM, and could care less about BRI money. MLSE is already making major profits on this team and have no reason to change their conservative budget ways as we"ve seen in recent years. Getting a bigger slice of the BRI pie would only pad their pockets further. For them, a new system is pretty much their only hope- otherwise they"re just laughing all the way to the bank.</text>

	<text>In a post I made earlier today I was kidding that nobody wanted to see the Toronto Raptors this year anyway. The truth is alot of people do miss the sport and alot of non NBA players and non NBA owners are suffering. The team employees, the arena staff, and all the restaurants and bars that rely on the NBA for income are all suffering. And the ironic thing about this whole mess is that both the players and the owners side knows who is going to win the dispute. THE OWNERS!!! It"s their league and ultimately they control the show. So why would the players not accept the latest offer with the risk of getting a worse offer if they don"t??. Some say greed, some say stupidity. It"s a combination of both. The NBA players should have learned from the NHL lock out several years ago that they really had no chance against Stern and a unified group of owners. So to the NBA players; DO THE DEAL!!! Not for your sake, but for the sake of the fans and for the sake of the people that rely on your league to just simply survive.</text>

	<text>Derek Fisher and the rest of the NBAPA can stand at the podium and say what they, but this is essentially a situation that is primarily about greed. NBA Players have all of their meals, flights, accomodations paid for by their teams and THEN they get paid their 3, 4, 5, 6 million dollar annual salaries...? How is it that I know of 5 people off the top of my head that have a family of 5 to support off a $50,000 dollar salary? It"s because that"s the average income and everybody knows people who budget their money and support their family. None of these guys live within their means, they all drive fancy cars in huge houses and their complaining that they won"t be able to afford that anymore? Try not being able to pay electricity or hydro bills... Those are problems.</text>

	<text>How about take 20% of revenues and use that to decrease ticket prices by that proportionate amount for the following season .  It is a fact that if players accepted  a wage cut ticket prices would decrease.  Too bad fans could not be represented in these negotiations and be at the bargaining table.  It would be great to see a "fan" union, and agreement amongst all fans that if their needs aren"t met no games will be attended.  Or maybe.....???</text>

	<text>@2theninez, you should do some research on inflation, rise of team revenues, and rise of team franchise values. Players get paid a lot yea, and we as fans are charged way too much for tickets, which I doubt is ever going to change, since owners will get way too used to the higher revenues from having to pay players less to lower ticket prices for us. So if the choice is between owners or players making more money, I"m on the players side, they"re the ones that put their bodies at risk.</text>

	<text>Why are players even getting any of the revenue.  They should agree to work for a salary like the rest of us and that is that.  Whatever the owners decided to make revenue and profit wise, is their business, since they are the boss, for crying out loud.  If I go to work and agree to a salary of 50K, that"s what I get.  I don"t get a share of my company"s profits unless they are offered to me.  This sense of entitlement is what I hate about the NBA and most of its players.</text>

	<text>Most humans are greedy.  Think about your own life. Do you think you deserve a pay raise? Of course you do. We all do. The same thing is going on here. The players will not win this disagreement though. It is a waiting game and the owners just have too much money therefore they can wait longer.</text>

	<text>Ok so here`s an idea. Give the players a 70-30 split, BUT all stadium employees, concession stand workers, managers, GM`s, etc, etc get paid from the Union`s 70 cut. Think the players will do it? Neither do I. So why should the owners take a 49% cut and have to pay ALL basketball related expenses outside of player salaries??</text>

	<text>A deal tonight will show just how greedy the players are.  Come on, lets face it, they were going to start missing paychecks on Nov 15.  Did anyone honestly believe these greedy players would allow that?  So after the deal is announced tonight, mark my words, Billy Hunter and Derek fisher will hug, put on a smile and make it look like they struck a great deal for their union, and then also state that they gave up some concessions for the good of the game and the fans.  At that point, I"ll just throw up.</text>

	<text>Got to love how all the so called hockey fans are on an NBA chat, obviously hockey"s is boring.  I have nothing against hockey bit don"t watch it and would never be on a hockey chat; too many interesting chats for me to read.  My guess is these people just like to complain and have zero tolerance for pretty much anything; in a way I feel bad for them.</text>

	<text>It baffles me that every time this happens, people turn on the players because they are too greedy, making too much.  This means you side with the owners, who are even more wealthy.  Makes little sense to me.  Let an owner work at Subway and see how the real world is.  Many of the players grew up poor; they understand it.  The owners?  Not so much.</text>

	<text>I have been pro-owners throughout this whole ordeal, but the players have given up A LOT, and I have to tell you that after a while, it gets hard to hear owners whine and complain that they can"t make money, and then watch them turn around and sign Eddy Curry, or Darko Milicic, or Adonal Foyle-type contracts.  The players have given up 7% on BRI, contract lengths are shorter by a year, raises are smaller, the MLE is smaller, the luxury tax will be more punitive.  With 15% more revenue 43% -" 50% and all the other concessions, owners need to be able to take on the remaining challenges themselves.  Get a deal done.</text>

	<text>@Roboninja, not all owners grow up wealthy. Many of them earned their money the hard way. The players are extremely greedy, they take none of the financial risk of the team, company or arena on their shoulders, so why should they receive more than 50 percent of this income?</text>

	<text>The two sides are obviously going nowhere, so cancel the season already, and don"t let the players back until there is a hard cap, for the betterment of the NBA as a whole.  Nicks, Lakers, Heat etc, cannot be allowed to overspend to suit only their markets and let the NBA as a whole suffer because of a few larger markets.  The NBA will die a slow or perhaps not so slow death if no hard cap is put in place before they play again.  Players need to learn what hard times are all about.  The rest of the world is feeling it, why shouldn"t they?</text>

	<text>@OnAzn, I"m a firm believer that the old system has caused the Raptors to be a laughingstock for so long. It has allowed their owners all the excuses in the world to not spend as much money as they should, given how much money was coming in. Teams like that need to be protected from themselves. And fans of those teams like me are willing to wait this out for seasonS, if necessary, to prevent it from happening anymore. I"d rather do that than have to watch this abominable operation continue like it has. The system MUST change for teams like the Raptors and I"d prefer to wait as long as it takes- because no basketball at all is better than the basketball we"ve seen lately... and by lately I mean their first 15 years. :</text>

	<text>I think when they make a deal, they should have to pay retro pay to all the employees who make tens of thousands of dollars a year to keep these guys fed, hydrated, in clean uniforms, in a clear locker room, etc. They are the ones really being hurt by this. Neither the owners or players care about them. I wish sports organizations had to give 50% of their profits back to the communities that support and pay for them to be there. No one needs tens of millions or more a year. Sports players, coaches, and owners have proven it time and time again, this kind of money only gets you into trouble. Most of these guys will be bankrupt within 10 years of leaving the game - what a waste of money! How many people are starving in the world today?</text>

	<text>The very moment we see the 53-47 deal proposed, the season will be done for. There"s not a sliver of a chance that the players are taking a 10% revenue cut, PLUS the hard cap, PLUS salary cuts. The entire nature of these negotiations has been a stalemate from day 1. The players want things to stay quite similar, while the owners are calling for significant changes. Maybe they"ll surprise us and actually agree on the terms, but the way it looks right now, we could be seeing these lockout stories well into next year.</text>
