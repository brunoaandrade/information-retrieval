	<text>Today'sThe New York TimesSunday business sectionincludes a front-page feature with contributions from six accomplished economists: Gregory Mankiw,Christina Romer, Tyler Cowen, Robert Frank, Robert Shiller, and Richard Thaler.The piece, titledI Just Got Here, but I Know Trouble When I See It, tackles various economic issues.Robert Shiller, the economist who co-created theCase-Shiller home price indexand famously predicted the housing bubble, discusses the ailing housing market and points to a fix by changing tax incentives:Prof. Richard K. Green, directorof theLusk Center for Real Estateat the University of Southern California,has proposed changing the tax systemso that it offers stronger, more targeted encouragement for home-ownership by focusing on people who might be giving up the dream of buying any home at all. The current mortgage interest deduction, Professor Green argues, based on his work with Prof. Andrew Reschovsky of the University of Wisconsin, is mostly an incentive for relatively wealthy people to build bigger houses, rather than for people of modest means to buy a home. It also provides a strong incentive only for people in high tax brackets, who benefit more because of their higher marginal tax rates, and who tend to itemize because the standard deduction is less advantageous for them.Professor Green wants to offer more help for lower-income taxpayers. He suggests creating a refundable tax credit as a percentage of mortgage interest payments, one that could be used even by those who take the standard deduction. This credit, presumably with some dollar limit, would be available to all homeowners. (That is in contrast to the HARP 2.0 mortgage refinancing program from the Obama administration; it is available, arbitrarily, only to those withFannie MaeandFreddie Macmortgages.) Professor Green proposes paying for this change by gradually phasing out the existing mortgage interest deduction."Shiller is a champion of home ownership: "Homeownership fosters citizenship, builds stronger families and communities, encourages active participation in the economy and, ultimately, bolsters economic confidence."Read the rest of Shiller's comments as well as the contributions from the other five economists at NYTimes.com &gt;SEE ALSO:The 18 Cities Where Home Prices Are Still Falling</text>

	<text>No, the tax deduction incentive causes people to invest in an unproductive asset and turn it into a trading commodity which is what housing has become, not something of utility. Those investment dollars are probably better spent buying stock in a company inventing things or funding other innovations. There's nothing innovative about housing.</text>

Er, when exactly has an economist accomplished anything but look back in the rear view mirror and say &quot;It happened that way because....&quot;.

Economists cannot tell you or i what their own family will spend or do in the next 3 months, let alone what 1 million of 7billion people will do.

It's a pseudo science of the worst kind, at best it is a type of history and not at all useful to predict what will happen. Their models are flawed.</text>

	<text>The Basic notion that you consider you &quot;HOME&quot; an investment is utterly wrong a house maybe. Housing prices can only rise by one factor on an overall economy and that is population growth. If the world's/ US populus keeps growing, other problems will come to be as high rise of basic necesities such as electricity, oil, food, clean water, etc. which will make harder for the dayli substance, let alone buying a house. goo.gl/Tt7eF</text>

	<text>Some people believe there is no problem with renting. In order to buy a home, you must be able to afford the payments. I doubt a small tax break would help many. On the other hand, a huge fall in home prices would make the more affordable.</text>

	<text>&quot;Property is the fruit of labor...property is desirable...is a positive good in the world. That some should be rich shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise.

 Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another; but let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built.&quot;

--Abraham Lincoln

But wait!

 Now you can work a lifetime to pay off the mortgage and &quot;own&quot; it free and clear and due to old age, be unable to pay for the lavish pensions, salaries, and benefits of unionized govt workers via abusive property taxes and lose this property that you allegedly own.

Property taxes are the most unfair taxes of them all!</text>

	<author>The solution is way simpler...</author>
	<text>... Than the solutions offered by marketeers and establishment economist. Simply allow underwater homeowners to extend the term of the standard issue loan from 30 years to 40 or even 50! People will not be thrown in the streets, equity will improve over time, and moral hazard is eliminated. Why hasn't this happened? because WS, banks, and politicians won't make it so.</text>

	<text>Blah -- Blah - BLah 

Same talking points - I'm all for take over and squatters right if they are taken from any bank that received a bail out in any form.

The little guy needs to get back his money. Just because the Banking Gangsters were able to buy like cheap hookers our elected boomer criminal class - (which by the way has given me respect for those ladies in the street) and maked them do unspeakable things - does not mean that the little guy which are the non-boomer younger generation is going to take it like a good dumb serf.</text>

	<text>The US is moving more and more to a European socialist model. It wouldn't surprise me if the left took advantage of the current bad housing and economic situation to push for squatters rights laws like in the UK whereby merely taking over a property gives you rights to it. Owners will have to go through a lengthy and expensive legal process to be granted eviction rights. Groups like OWS will aggressively encourage people to stop paying their mortgages or to move into abandoned homes and take possession of them.

The Left might also push for state or federal takeover of properties, turning them into government-run projects like we saw in the 60s and 70s but with single-unit houses instead of high-rises. If the government takes over only part of a neighborhood, the home values of the remaining units will plummet. They'll quickly turn into government-protected breeding grounds for crime and drug trafficking.</text>

	<text>My house is across the street from a foreclosure that took place 2 years ago because the deadbeats were over leveraged on a good faith mortgage. The poster children for GW Bush &amp; Schiller's America where everyone owns a home. Stop the nonsense with these ridiculous incentives. It only hurts those of us able to afford the house - and responsible enough not to walk away when times are tough.</text>
