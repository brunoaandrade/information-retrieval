However, they often offer extraordinary growth opportunities that eclipse those offered by the more developed EMs.In a recent report, Citi's Andrew Howell identifies 15 "Frontier" markets that will provide big returns for investors for decades.&nbsp; Some, like Argentina and Venezuela, are well known.&nbsp; But, others, like Ghana and Kazakhstan, often go overlooked.Click here to see the hottest frontier countries &gt;Click here to see the hottest frontier countries &gt;</text>

	<text>The facts are really staggering, the stakes tend to be substantial, it can be tough to discuss and even harder to do something about it. Technology, therapy, communicating... all of them compete with human nature. In addition to each circumstance is different.</text>

	<text>Can't believe anyone is recommending investing in Argentina. Days after the current Presidenta was reelected the government install restrictions on currency exchange. 

The government has consistently under reported inflation (estimated to be 25%) to avoid paying more interest on inflation indexed bonds. 

If you think an investment in Argentina's agriculture industry is interesting...think again. All agricultural exports are hit with massive export duties in an attempt to keep food prices low for the rabble that keeps the government in power. 

Bottom line; if you produce anything, you will not be able to export it profitably, Any earnings in pesos will be eaten up by inflation and the government will do everything possible to prevent you from exchanging the quickly eroding pesos into dollars or euros.</text>

	<text>Good article. Indeed if we can position ourselves before the frontier market takes off, we will be reaping lots of harvest. Question is, is the extreme risk manageable?! Forex trading in these currencies is also a new frontier to be pondered about.</text>

	<text>One thing I don't understand about credit ratings in general, whether downgrades or upgrades, is that they are self-referencing/recursive. This is the case with personal, corporate, or sovreign credit ratings. It's a determination of risk of default, but also kind a liklihood of an opportunity loss as a creditor's money is tied up, and so on.

By comparison, looking at standard insurance premiums, this is also a determination is risk related to paying for a loss vs. taking in related premiums, in other words, an insurance loss ratio. But the insurance premiums that are paid in no real way effects the odds of parcipitating a loss; paying more or less does not affect the risk of a loss occuring. This is the case with any type of property &amp; loss insuance; a homebuilder will not be any more or less likley to be hit with a fire or a hurricane or a tornado just because their premiums are higher or lower, or a autoinsurance driver will in no way be more or less likely to get into an accident if their insurance premiums are more or less. The rating does not affect what the ratings are measuring.

But with credit ratings, this is not true. They are self-feeding. Since the downgrade has occurred, it SHOULD mean that the interest rate the US is paying will go up and will indeed affect the liklihood of further cuts. f(x) = y, but the independent variable is not independent. Sae would apply to a personal credit rating getting lowered, that affects the payments that have to be paid, and in turn almost guarantees an eventual total default on the debt.

That's why I'm worried, with the amount of debt that is there for the US, and the amount tht as to be paid just to service the debt, maybe $200B per year goes up to $400B per year if the amount of the debt stayed the same, butsince the marco conditions seem to grind down, then the debt will urther baloon, more borrowing, more cuts, and the printing frenzy ensues. I know it will take months and years for this to come to a head, but that is how it will end, it has to. The US fiat currency will end up like all other fiat currencies, in the dust bin.
