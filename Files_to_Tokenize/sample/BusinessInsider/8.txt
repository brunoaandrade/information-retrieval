	<text>For probably the last 10 years or more, I haveavoided the Holiday madness centered aroundconsumerism and corporate greed. I still donot support these travesties. However, justyesterday, I purchased two pairs of Harley-Davidson riding boots, one pair $37.50, theother pair $43.50! The sale started today butthe clerk gave me the sale price....you gottaadmit, it's a good feeling you get when youknow you spent $80 instead of $300!</text>

	<text>- And the chap's sitting in a Network SouthEast train - from the seat design / covering!! Possibly dates from around 2004, sicne I believe they now have a different fabric design. The moulded GRP seat frame came in around the early 1990's on the Wessex Electric Class 226 sets (&quot;Insider Knowledge - I used to work for BR!!)</text>

	<text>Meredith did a really crappy job of sourcing photos. The Nebraska photo has a guy wearing a Vodaphone / Manchester United shirt and drinking a Boddington's. Clearly it's a photo from the UK. Meredith doesn't get out much.</text>

	<text>Kapa'a Hawaii in on the island of Kauai. I truly cannot understand why anyone living on Kauai would need to drink.

Anyway, an observation. Founding James Gang member and Eagle's guitarist Joe Walsh once said something to the effect that he only got drunk once. It was in 1977 and he didn't sober-up until 2000.</text>
