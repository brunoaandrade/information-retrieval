	<text>Hmmmm... It's good, that the soft is free, but, to my mind, K9 has horrible installation interface, Winn live can be easily cheated or broken by anyone, who's older, that 12, Chat Controller interferes with your child privacy (and I think any teenager has the right for some), Kidlogger also fits for small ones only, and AOL has horrible interface. I am sorry the list is missing TimeBoss nicekit.ru/parental-control/time-boss.phpIt's not free, and it works with IE only, but at the moment it's the best I've seen.</text>

Especially, I like to seemany examples for various applications. These examples and theMaple programs make it well suitable for students to learnon dynamical systems by themself.</text>

A report (etechmagdotcom) confirms that iPad3 has entered into mass production at Foxconn China and Apple has its eyes focused to release this enhanced tablet in March.

	<text>I want to show thanks to this writer for bailing me out of this challenge. After scouting through the internet and meeting tips which are not helpful, I was thinking my life was gone. Living devoid of the solutions to the problems you've resolved through your main guide is a serious case, as well as the kind which might have adversely damaged my career if I hadn't noticed the website. Your own personal knowledge and kindness in dealing with every part was invaluable. I am not sure what I would've done if I hadn't encountered such a thing like this. I'm able to at this time look ahead to my future. Thanks for your time very much for your specialized and result oriented help. I won't think twice to propose your web blog to anyone who would like tips on this subject matter.</text>

	<text>People...who wants to buy a product that is programmed to be obsolete within 26-weeks? All of the Apple hoopla harkens back to the company's awesome 1984 commercial. The only problem is, that the 1984 IBM audience has morphed into millions of brain dead Apple proles, portrayed so succinctly in the original film.</text>

	<text>The iPad 3, which will be released sometime in 2012, is a perfect match for the features of kikin Browser, an iPad app available for download in the App Store: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/kikinappstore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/kikinappstore&lt;/a&gt;. kikin Browser's most notable feature is the 'long press,' which is when users press and hold a specific term on a Web page and kikin Browser brings up search and image results without opening a new page or tab. In addition, kikin Browser allows users to slide their finger horizontally to the left to go back to a page rather than pressing Safari's tiny 'Back' button. The newest version of kikin Browser was updated for more Twitter integration into the browser along with a variety of other unique features. Learn more about kikin Browser and its features at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/kikinsite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://bit.ly/kikinsite&lt;/a&gt;.</text>

	<text>Hey I have been getting text messages from (862) 228-5683 telling me that I have just won and iPad 4, all I have to do is pay $39.95 S&amp;H. Yea Right? So I decided to have a little fun with these idiots. I replied to their text with: &quot;I am not familiar with i-pads, besides I prefer to use Depends brand. Sorry not interested.&quot;

I wonder if I will be getting any more phishing scams from these guys?</text>

	<text>This churning through generations of products has fully captured the imagination of many. Good for Apple, I guess. Seems a tad crazy and obsessive (not to mention wasteful) to me.

	<text>My &quot;fearless&quot; 2012 iPad2/3 predictions:

On February 24th Apple will introduce the iPad3. It will have a Quad-core Ax processor, full HD IGZO (retina) display, improved battery and Siri. It will be the same size and weight as the iPad2. The price points will be the same as the iPad2:
iPad3 $499 16gb WiFi only
iPad3 $599 32gb WiFi only
iPad3 $699 64gb WiFi only
iPad3 $629 16gb Universal 3G/WiFi
iPad3 $729 32gb Universal 3G/WiFi
iPad3 $829 64gb Universal 3G/WiFi

iPad2 will continue &quot;as is&quot; but with less storage and new price points:
iPad2 $249 8gb WiFi only
iPad2 $299 16gb WiFi only
iPad2 $349 8gb 3G/Wifi (separate GSM/CMDA models)
iPad2 $399 16gb 3G/WiFi (separate GSM/CMDA models)

If Apple does this they will raise a formidable price/performance bar for all competing tablets. 1 Jan, 09:36 PM</text>

	<text>I did and I love it! already Quad Core, accepts mini SD cards, optional keyboard has USB ports (2!) and a full SD card slot, with 12 to 16 hours battery life with the keyboard. Android is a true multitasking environment, unlike the task switching of iOS (hey that's like the old 286 was task switching, but the 386 onward were multitasking!)

	<text>I have to say Im not that impressed by Apples products. They seem to be merely tools for shopping or being bombarded by advertising. You get a device that 'business' can use to sell you something right in your home. Almost like a phone / TV (QVC or SEARS) catalog. That's nothing more than a toy that costs a small fortune. Trinkets are interesting, but their value is limited.</text>
