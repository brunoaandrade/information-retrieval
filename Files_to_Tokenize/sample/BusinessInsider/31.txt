	<text>Hey mate, I see what you are trying to say, but with the economy today it's challenging for most of us to move forward. My brother has been buying gold eagles on the web and offering them to brick and mortar dealers. He has made a fortune with this method so I'm going to give it a shot too. I will let you know how it works out and get in touch.</text>

	<text>Hi, I know what you are saying, but with the global recession it's difficult for many of us to make money. My brother has been purchasing american eagle coins on the web and selling to brick and mortar dealers. He has made a ton of money with this technique so I'm going to give it a try too. I will see how it goes and report back.</text>
