	<text>It's New Year's resolution time, and Mark Cuban's new book offers the rationale for a good one.There's only one thing you can control in your life--your own effort.So if you want to give yourself and your company the best chance of success, work harder.Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, tells the story of how, at 27, he was finally making "twice his age." His first company was doing well, and he had finally upgraded from 2-for-$99 polyester suits. He was engaged to get married, and he had just spent his entire savings--$7.500--on a ring. Then his fiance lost the ring in a movie theater, and a couple of months later, the relationship broke up.The one thing Cuban had to fall back on was his business. And he rededicated himself to it:In sports, the only thing a player can truly control is effort. The same applies to business. The only thing any entrepreneur, salesperson or anyone in any position can control is their effort.I had to kick myself in the ass and recommit to getting up early, staying up late and consuming everything I possibly could to get an edge. I had to commit to making the effort to be as productive as I possibly could. It meant making sure that every hour of the day that I could contact a customer was selling time, and when customers were sleeping, I was doing things that prepared me to make more sales and to make my company better.And finally, I had to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t lying to myself about how hard I was working. It would have been easy to judge effort by how many hours a day passed while I was at work. That&rsquo;s the worst way to measure effort.Effort is measured by setting goals and getting results. What did I need to do to close this account? What did I need to do to win this segment of business? What did I need to do to understand this technology or that business better than anyone? What did I need to do to find an edge?Wheredoes that edge come from, and how was I going to get there?The one requirement for success in our business lives is effort. Either you make the commitment to get results or you don't.That second point is critical, too. Making more of an effort is not the same thing as working longer. It's workingbetter--setting goals and getting results.Here are links to excerpts from Cuban's new book:How To Win At The Sport Of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It.Click to preview.Includes ePub, Mobi, and PDF.Works with Kindle, Nook, iPad, PC, Mac, and smartphones.Or buy via:Amazon,Barnes &amp; Noble, orApple</text>

	<text>@Rice Protein You seem to have a problem with &quot;dotcom&quot;. Give it up. Cuban built a successful business. Reread the excerpt. He was talking about closing deals, not hyping an idea. His most successful sale was finding somebody who was willing to overpay for his company. (Not unlike Jobs and his Macs) He took the deal and moved on. Nothing wrong with that.</text>

	<text>Even dotcom business execs worked hard for their successes. Look at how many failed and lost everything, while Mark Cuban succeeded. Technology and customer demand changes burst the dotcom bubble, as much as , common business sense.

Effort IS the only thing you can control. Inspiration and luck are big pieces to most success stories. Effort recognizes inspiration, takes advantage of luck, and makes something happen. Instant success is not so instant any more and too many people want the instant gratification of success without the long-term effort. Ideas are easy. Implementation is hard.</text>

And when I investigate, usually a person has every window open besides work, from music to blogs to photo sites.... concentrated, repeated, calibrated and measure effort towartds intermediate goals that align to longer-term goals.

I dare say the world is &quot;filled&quot; with folk who worked hard and behaved well yet never achieved his level, or even close, of financial success. What's the key to success?</text>

Don't get me wrong, effort is NO guarantee of success but without it there is no chance.

The sports arena is littered with highly talented people that never succeeded because of their lack of desire and lack of effort!

No, not everyone works hard!</text>

	<text>Thanks Henry &amp; Mark,

It is a good article and the preview of the book looks good too!

Basic down to earth advice, easy to read but a reminder that no matter where we start there is a chance to improve!

Calvin Coolidge spoke of the importance of persistence.
“Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. 
Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'press on' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race”

I would not &quot;argue the toss&quot; on persistence vs effort.

I am sure &quot;luck&quot; make a difference, however on that front, I think there is a lot to be said about &quot;making our own luck&quot;.

Kind regards
Helmut Maertin

Life just isn't fair. Some guys just jump and run faster than you. He's really stupid if he thinks effort plays a big part in NBA. He's really really stupid if he thinks effort is the main ingredient in a successful life as he knows it. He should just stfu. Effort leading to success can only be applied to meager everyday joe like me and you. Not Mark.</text>

	<text>Agreed -- but I am not sure about the &quot;mark cuban&quot; did nothing thing. It is like saying the Yahoo people were not only idiots but corrupt and ill-intended. It might look like a good business at the time and Cuban had built something that appealed to the Yahoo execs. I bet there was a lot of skilled negotiation from the part of Cuban to close this deal. Maybe if he stayed at Broadcast it will be buying Yahoo today. Who knows?
I'd like to know more about the details of Broadcast.com (as an operating company, revenue, number of employees, etc) but a quick search does not bring much info... And it's Jan 1st, come on!
Happy New Year.</text>

	<text>Luck may put people in certain circumstances, then they rise or fall based on their abilities. This may be the case of Jobs, Shultz, etc. But in Cuban's case, luck determined the final outcome of selling a bubble dot-com to Yahoo for an astronomical sum. After that, all he's done is spend that money with a lot of talk (not unlike Jason Calacanis, but least Cuban has had a moderate successes or two whereas Jason is all hat and no cattle).</text>

	<text>You can appreciate people like Jobs or Welch without wanting to duplicate their poor qualities. I get so tired of hearing the losers whine about how much &quot;luck&quot; guys like Cuban have. When you approach things with max effort every second of every day, you get &quot;lucky&quot;. You see things that others don't because your fully invested. Most people are not willing to pay the price of the great business people. It's about more than just brains as well....I know smart people who have trouble getting off the couch.
Bottom line, if you want something, you can figure out how to get it. It won't be easy, it will test every fiber of your being, they'll be days your certain it's over....and then, you win. You've got to wade thru a lot of crap to get to the gold. But, most people are not willing to do it...and then they blame bad luck. Nope, that's not it. Look deeper, it's all there, for those who want it.
It's nothing to do with luck. That, I can promise you.</text>

	<text>Of course luck plays a big factor into any successful business, but the point I was making is these guys ran real, sustainable businesses. Cuban started a dotcom and sold it, then tries to get people to believe he's a real business man. That is my beef with him. I'm not begrudging his success, at all, but don't go writing books about &quot;effort&quot; and &quot;hard work&quot; when your biggest success was a dotcom.</text>

If this guy hadn't been in the right place at the right time to sell his worthless dotcom company, Broadcast.com, (as proof, try trying that URL in) to an even dumber dotcom company, Yahoo, then no on would know who he is and he wouldn't be writing snake-oil advice books.

If you want real business advice read about someone who actually built a business, ran it and sustained it. Steve Jobs, Howard Schultz, Jack Welch are the first to come to mind. Mark Cuban isn't even in the same league as these guys.</text>
