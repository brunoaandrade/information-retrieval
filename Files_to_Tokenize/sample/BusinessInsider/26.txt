	<text>There are some resellers who sells hosting at $10/year on ebay. That can save costs too. (Even hosts like justhost.com also offers unmetered bandwidth hosting. Another good option for reliable and less costly hosting). As Kendra said, yeah cost of SSL should also be considered when someone install shopping cart on them. It actually depends on kind of business it is.</text>
