	<title>A Gut Wrenching Look Inside Lakewood New Jersey's Homeless 'Tent City'  - Business Insider</title>

	<text>Robert JohnsonGoogle MapsDoug Hardman wakes up every morning with a song in his head&mdash;a vague memory of his days on stage.Inside his tepee in the woods outside Lakewood, NJ, at the homeless Tent City, the roosters wake early and the mornings are already cooler. A musician who lost his Florida home in the housing crisis, Hardman says he floats in and out of Tent City, that he's proud of his kids, and misses the life he no longer has.He has a lot of company out here.Click here for the pictures and story &gt;Tent City made the news recently and while community leader Steven Brigham says the media attention brought in greater donations, it also brought unwanted attention from the local politicians.After battling with the city for years to have access to the public land here, Brigham found a New Jersey lawyer to represent his case pro bono.The attorney, Jeff Wild, argued that the homeless population are part of the public and should therefore have access to public lands. Rather than take the case to court, Lakewood City Council settled, and Brigham signed an agreement to put up no more shelters and allow no more than 70 people to stay.But last winter the community put up three wooden structures to house everyone and keep them warm."We didn't lose anybody last year," Brigham says, "and nobody got sick."This year could be different. After City Council members saw the shelters on TV, they sent demolition crews in. The walls were torn down around whatever was inside, and meager furnishings were left to the elements.This year, the tent city's residents will have to put wood-stoves in tents and plastic shanties, increasing fire risk. Brigham says the town is making it impossible to survive there, hoping to get the homeless out, and he's concerned it will end up killing people this year.More than 700,000 people are currently homeless in the U.S. and the number has grown 20 percent from 2007 to 2010.A recent UN reportsays the way the U.S. denies its citizens access to water, basic sanitation, and criminalizes homelessness is a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.Brigham can relate. He started the camp five years ago and more people show up every year. Some stay, some find part-time work where they can, move on, and wind up coming back."There's a real glut of low-skilled manual labor in the area," he says. "There's just nothing for people to do."Brigham works as a high-voltage electrical contractor on the bridges and tunnels around New York, but his mission is here in the Lakewood forest."I found this spot that had no underbrush, which is very unusual," he says, "and this community's become a living protest."I ask him what he means, and he says, "We're protesting the insincerity of the political system. It's supposed to be for the people and its not."Update:This story originally ran in September 2011 and at the time the fate of this homeless population in New Jersey was still very much in question. Some things have changed since then, but look for an update on the group's legal battle with the city of Lakewood in the coming weeks. Rj(Reverend Steve Brigham can be reached at P.O. Box 326, Lakewood, NJ 08701)Click here for the pictures and story &gt;Click here for the pictures and story &gt;</text>

	<text>The deal is that I am out here in montana , however my wife and I donate clothes to the rescue missions and shelters near where we live , and there is a huge homeless problem here in this area of montana , which has gotten progressively worse in recent years, kind of surprising in this area as it never used to be this way. We also donate money to the animal shelters in this area, as people are turning in their pets when they cant afford them anymore, pretty sad, never thought I would live to see what is happening in this country, may god bless you and keep you in your efforts to help the homeless.</text>

	<text>A Christmas Message From America's Rich
Rolling Stone
Matt Taibbi

It seems America’s bankers are tired of all the abuse. They’ve decided to speak out.

True, they’re doing it from behind the ropeline, in front of friendly crowds at industry conferences and country clubs, meaning they don’t have to look the rest of America in the eye when they call us all imbeciles and complain that they shouldn’t have to apologize for being so successful.

But while they haven’t yet deigned to talk to protesting America face to face, they are willing to scribble out some complaints on notes and send them downstairs on silver trays. Courtesy of a remarkable story by Max Abelson at Bloomberg, we now get to hear some of those choice comments.

Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, for instance, is not worried about OWS:

“Who gives a crap about some imbecile?” Marcus said. “Are you kidding me?”

Former New York gurbernatorial candidate Tom Golisano, the billionaire owner of the billing firm Paychex, offered his wisdom while his half-his-age tennis champion girlfriend hung on his arm:

“If I hear a politician use the term ‘paying your fair share’ one more time, I’m going to vomit,” said Golisano, who turned 70 last month, celebrating the birthday with girlfriend Monica Seles, the former tennis star who won nine Grand Slam singles titles.

Then there’s Leon Cooperman, the former chief of Goldman Sachs’s money-management unit, who said he was urged to speak out by his fellow golfers. His message was a version of Wall Street’s increasingly popular If-you-people-want-a-job, then-you’ll-shut-the-fuck-up rhetorical line:

Cooperman, 68, said in an interview that he can’t walk through the dining room of St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton, Florida, without being thanked for speaking up. At least four people expressed their gratitude on Dec. 5 while he was eating an egg-white omelet, he said.

“You’ll get more out of me,” the billionaire said, “if you treat me with respect.”

Finally, there is this from Blackstone CEO Steven Schwartzman:

Asked if he were willing to pay more taxes in a Nov. 30 interview with Bloomberg Television, Blackstone Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman spoke about lower-income U.S. families who pay no income tax.

“You have to have skin in the game,” said Schwarzman, 64. “I’m not saying how much people should do. But we should all be part of the system.”

There are obviously a great many things that one could say about this remarkable collection of quotes. One could even, if one wanted, simply savor them alone, without commentary, like lumps of fresh caviar, or raw oysters.

But out of Abelson’s collection of doleful woe-is-us complaints from the offended rich, the one that deserves the most attention is Schwarzman’s line about lower-income folks lacking “skin in the game.” This incredible statement gets right to the heart of why these people suck.

Why? It's not because Schwarzman is factually wrong about lower-income people having no “skin in the game,” ignoring the fact that everyone pays sales taxes, and most everyone pays payroll taxes, and of course there are property taxes for even the lowliest subprime mortgage holders, and so on.

It’s not even because Schwarzman probably himself pays close to zero in income tax – as a private equity chief, he doesn’t pay income tax but tax on carried interest, which carries a maximum 15% tax rate, half the rate of a New York City firefighter.

The real issue has to do with the context of Schwarzman’s quote. The Blackstone billionaire, remember, is one of the more uniquely abhorrent, self-congratulating jerks in the entire world – a man who famously symbolized the excesses of the crisis era when, just as the rest of America was heading into a recession, he threw himself a $5 million birthday party, featuring private performances by Rod Stewart and Patti Labelle, to celebrate an IPO that made him $677 million in a matter of days (within a year, incidentally, the investors who bought that stock would lose three-fourths of their investments).

So that IPO birthday boy is now standing up and insisting, with a straight face, that America’s problem is that compared to taxpaying billionaires like himself, poor people are not invested enough in our society’s future. Apparently, we’d all be in much better shape if the poor were as motivated as Steven Schwarzman is to make America a better place. 

But it seems to me that if you’re broke enough that you’re not paying any income tax, you’ve got nothing but skin in the game. You've got it all riding on how well America works.

You can’t afford private security: you need to depend on the police. You can’t afford private health care: Medicare is all you have. You get arrested, you’re not hiring Davis, Polk to get you out of jail: you rely on a public defender to negotiate a court system you'd better pray deals with everyone from the same deck. And you can’t hire landscapers to manicure your lawn and trim your trees: you need the garbage man to come on time and you need the city to patch the potholes in your street.

And in the bigger picture, of course, you need the state and the private sector both to be functioning well enough to provide you with regular work, and a safe place to raise your children, and clean water and clean air.

The entire ethos of modern Wall Street, on the other hand, is complete indifference to all of these matters. The very rich on today’s Wall Street are now so rich that they buy their own social infrastructure. They hire private security, they live on gated mansions on islands and other tax havens, and most notably, they buy their own justice and their own government.

An ordinary person who has a problem that needs fixing puts a letter in the mail to his congressman and sends it to stand in a line in some DC mailroom with thousands of others, waiting for a response.

But citizens of the stateless archipelago where people like Schwarzman live spend millions a year lobbying and donating to political campaigns so that they can jump the line. They don’t need to make sure the government is fulfilling its customer-service obligations, because they buy special access to the government, and get the special service and the metaphorical comped bottle of VIP-room Cristal afforded to select customers.

Want to lower the capital reserve requirements for investment banks? Then-Goldman CEO Hank Paulson takes a meeting with SEC chief Bill Donaldson, and gets it done. Want to kill an attempt to erase the carried interest tax break? Guys like Schwarzman, and Apollo’s Leon Black, and Carlyle’s David Rubenstein, they just show up in Washington at Max Baucus’s doorstep, and they get it killed.

Some of these people take that VIP-room idea a step further. J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon – the man the New York Times once called “Obama’s favorite banker” – had an excellent method of guaranteeing that the Federal Reserve system’s doors would always be open to him. What he did was, he served as the Chairman of the Board of the New York Fed.

And in 2008, in that moonlighting capacity, he helped orchestrate a deal in which the Fed provided $29 billion in assistance to help his own bank, Chase, buy up the teetering investment firm Bear Stearns. You read that right: Jamie Dimon helped give himself a bailout. Who needs to worry about good government, when you are the government?

Dimon, incidentally, is another one of those bankers who’s complaining now about the unfair criticism. “Acting like everyone who’s been successful is bad and because you’re rich you’re bad, I don’t understand it,” he recently said, at an investor’s conference.

Hmm. Is Dimon right? Do people hate him just because he’s rich and successful? That really would be unfair. Maybe we should ask the people of Jefferson County, Alabama, what they think.

That particular locality is now in bankruptcy proceedings primarily because Dimon’s bank, Chase, used middlemen to bribe local officials – literally bribe, with cash and watches and new suits – to sign on to a series of onerous interest-rate swap deals that vastly expanded the county’s debt burden.

Essentially, Jamie Dimon handed Birmingham, Alabama a Chase credit card and then bribed its local officials to run up a gigantic balance, leaving future residents and those residents’ children with the bill. As a result, the citizens of Jefferson County will now be making payments to Chase until the end of time.

Do you think Jamie Dimon would have done that deal if he lived in Jefferson County? Put it this way: if he was trying to support two kids on $30,000 a year, and lived in a Birmingham neighborhood full of people in the same boat, would he sign off on a deal that jacked up everyone’s sewer bills 400% for the next thirty years?

Doubtful. But then again, people like Jamie Dimon aren’t really citizens of any country. They live in their own gated archipelago, and the rest of the world is a dumping ground.

Just look at how banks like Chase behaved in Greece, for example.

Having seen how well interest-rate swaps worked for Jefferson County, Alabama, Chase “helped” countries like Greece and Italy mask their debt problems for years by selling a similar series of swaps to those governments. The bank then turned around and worked with banks like Goldman, Sachs (who were also major purveyors of those swap deals) to create a thing called the iTraxx SovX Western Europe index, which allowed investors to bet against Greek debt.

In other words, banks like Chase and Goldman knowingly larded up the nation of Greece with a crippling future debt burden, then turned around and helped the world bet against Greek debt.

Does a citizen of Greece do that deal? Forget that: does a human being do that deal?

Operations like the Greek swap/short index maneuver were easy money for banks like Goldman and Chase – hell, it’s a no-lose play, like cutting a car’s brake lines and then betting on the driver to crash – but they helped create the monstrous European debt problem that this very minute is threatening to send the entire world economy into collapse, which would result in who knows what horrors. At minimum, millions might lose their jobs and benefits and homes. Millions more will be ruined financially.

But why should Chase and Goldman care what happens to those people? Do they have any skin in that game?

Of course not. We’re talking about banks that not only didn’t warn the citizens of Greece about their future debt disaster, they actively traded on that information, to make money for themselves.

People like Dimon, and Schwarzman, and John Paulson, and all of the rest of them who think the “imbeciles” on the streets are simply full of reasonless class anger, they don’t get it. Nobody hates them for being successful. And not that this needs repeating, but nobody even minds that they are rich.

What makes people furious is that they have stopped being citizens.

Most of us 99-percenters couldn’t even let our dogs leave a dump on the sidewalk without feeling ashamed before our neighbors. It's called having a conscience: even though there are plenty of things most of us could get away with doing, we just don’t do them, because, well, we live here. Most of us wouldn’t take a million dollars to swindle the local school system, or put our next door neighbors out on the street with a robosigned foreclosure, or steal the life’s savings of some old pensioner down the block by selling him a bunch of worthless securities.

But our Too-Big-To-Fail banks unhesitatingly take billions in bailout money and then turn right around and finance the export of jobs to new locations in China and India. They defraud the pension funds of state workers into buying billions of their crap mortgage assets. They take zero-interest loans from the state and then lend that same money back to us at interest. Or, like Chase, they bribe the politicians serving countries and states and cities and even school boards to take on crippling debt deals.

Nobody with real skin in the game, who had any kind of stake in our collective future, would do any of those things. Or, if a person did do those things, you’d at least expect him to have enough shame not to whine to a Bloomberg reporter when the rest of us complained about it.

But these people don’t have shame. What they have, in the place where most of us have shame, are extra sets of balls. Just listen to Cooperman, the former Goldman exec from that country club in Boca. According to Cooperman, the rich do contribute to society:

Capitalists “are not the scourge that they are too often made out to be” and the wealthy aren’t “a monolithic, selfish and unfeeling lot,” Cooperman wrote. They make products that “fill store shelves at Christmas…”

Unbelievable. Merry Christmas, bankers. And good luck getting that message out.</text>

	<text>And at the same time that people are living in cars and tents and homeless shelters, the immoral idiots in congress at the urging of AIPAC and their cats paws carl levin, john mccain, lindsey graham, joe lieberman etc. passed a 662 billion NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT, that takes 66.2 % of the fiscal 1 trillion budget for war,, this works out to 55 billion a month and 1.8 billion a day for the wars that the dual israeli citizens who are in the most powerful positions in the government have pushed us into. People are living in cars and tents and the u.s. government is spending 1.8 billion a day to build drones, bombs, etc. to blow the hell out of countries without a declaration of war and without just cause, does anyone remember the last government that did this ,, does HITLERS THIRD REICH come to mind.

When obama signed the NDAA yesterday , a bill he had promised to veto, oh well liars lie dont they,,, with the signing of this bill america is now under the same controls that HITLER got when he had the SS burn the reichstag, a false flag, and blamed the communists and then got the REICHSTAG FIRE ACT passed which put germany under martial law and then HITLER followed this up with THE ENABLING ACT which gave him full dictatorial powers,, the NDAA is in many ways the same as the enabling act and the fire decree act.

AIPAC is in control of congress and AIPAC and the dual israeli citizens in the u.s. government pushed this NDAA through congress with carl levin as the point man,, these are the chicken hawk warmongers who are the reason american kids have been and are being sent into the middle east slaughter house, the american military is a proxy arm of the IDF and is being used to further the aims of netanyahus israel and the dual israelis in the u.s. government. 662 billion a year is being spent to keep the wheels greased with the blood of american kids and innocent middle east civilians , 1.8 billion a day spent on keeping the slaughter house going and people in america are living in cars and tents,,, MAY GOD FORGIVE US.</text>

	<text>New Jersey property taxes are high enough to make many of its local &quot;home owners&quot; homeless. Think how many homeless there would be in America if the Government cut off payments to the following:

&quot;In 2010, more than 18 percent of the nation's total personal income came from entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs, according to an analysis by USA Today. Wages made up the lowest share since government tracking began in 1929.&quot;

&quot;Medicaid enrollment for the first time ever topped 50 million in June 2010, the most recent figures available. &quot;

&quot;USDA data released this week shows that the number of Americans receiving food aid from the Supplemental Nutrional Assistance Program (SNAP) hit another all-time high in August. 45.8 million people.&quot;

&quot;The Center for Immigration Studies has released an in-depth report on the use of welfare programs provided by the U.S. to immigrants living in the country. The report indicates that 71 percent of illegal immigrants are receiving welfare benefits.&quot; 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://wwwwakeupamericans-spree.blogspot.com/2011/04/71-percent-of-illegal-immigrants.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://wwwwakeupamericans-spree.blogspot.com/2011/04/71-percent-of-illegal-immigrants.html&lt;/a&gt;

Government payouts make up 35 percent of wages and salaries this year, according to TrimTabs Investment Research using Bureau of Economic Analysis data.&quot;

There are over 12.4 million Government employees pulling down Federal, State and local government paychecks..

There are almost 9 million Americans collecting unemployment benefits.</text>

	<text>Hi, it’s me again. 

The article states that the United States is in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Do you think there would be any way for me to create a private investment vehicle to help Lakewood New Jersey privatize its water and sanitation services so I could then force these homeless people to pay me for their water and garbage collection?

Just asking.</text>

	<text>They should all ban together and rob banks. Either they get money or get free room/board in a prison. 

And honestly, why the fuck would you care that you're breaking the law in a heartless country that cares more about the FUCKING RICH getting tax breaks than helping the unemployed and homeless.</text>
