	<text>Facebook is a sleeping BEAST right now, slowly being prodded awake by traditional business advertisers trying their hands at FB marketing... NOW would be the time to cash in as a home business owner, but I haven't seen any comprehensive facebook ad training programs released for us yet. Know of any?</text>

Thank you for taking the time to write with awareness. Once In A While I look at a page and question whether they even proofread it.Fantastic work with this article.</text>

	<text>Placing strategic images and graphics are key on a site but too much of this will reduce your loading times I agree. The balance of having them and not having them is a balancing act. Great information!</text>
