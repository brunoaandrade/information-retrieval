	<text>Business Insider / Matthew LynleyThe Patents I Never Filed‚Ä¶Multicast Networks, Personalized Streaming and Advertising and Self Service HostingThe Mavs are a Business Unlike Any OtherWill Your College Go Out of Business Before You Graduate ?I thought this was appropriate to start the new year.We all have the tendency to believe that we are living in a very advanced technological period. We get all excited about the new tech we got at Xmas and what we read about that will soon be available to us. In reality, everything we are excited about today is going to be incredibly old and boring much faster than we ever expect.No matter what year you were born, by the time you finish(ed) high school, its (was) a completely different world. Today&rsquo;s high school seniors were born prior to the World Wide Web, wireless internet, smartphones,tablets, HDTVs &nbsp;and changes in world politics that were never imagined. &nbsp;Without question each of us can remember the things that were new and exciting to us when we were kids, that were unimaginable to our parents, but are now nothing more than old memories.The rate of technological change is not slowing down. In fact, the argument could be made that it is speeding up. &nbsp;In our lifetimes, we will reach a point when we reflect back on the good old days of the internet,Facebook,Twitterand other tech that is ubiquitous today. We might even look back at digital the way we currently look at analog.Thingschange.Of course, this isn&rsquo;t a problem. It&rsquo;s a huge opportunity. There is that 12 year old that is imagining what we can&rsquo;t. Another that is combining elements into something new we should have seen, but did not. It reminds me of one of my favorite sayings. &ldquo;If you are looking where everyone else is for the next big thing, you are looking in the wrong place&rdquo;The reality is,None of us are born in to the world we live in.This post wasoriginally publishedon BlogMaverick.Mark Cubanhas just published an excellent new book.

	<text>In the year I was born Harry Truman was elected president, the Marshall Plan was ongoing, few people made long-distance telephone calls (on black phones hardwired to the wall), hardly anyone had flown in an airplane for pleasure or business, FM radio was just starting to become popular, television sets had very small screens (often viewed with a mirror), the interstate highway system didn't exist yet, it goes on and on. Now everything I do is done on a computer in some form, I fly almost every week, i watch TV on my phone or tablet, I make calls to anywhere from anywhere. It has been quite an interesting journey and it is not over yet!</text>

	<text>The statistics are really staggering, the stakes tend to be massive, it really is challenging to discuss and even more complicated to deal with it. Technologies, counselling, communication... all of them compete with human nature. And also every situation is different.</text>

	<text>Considering that all information since inception to 2008 now comes every two days I would agree it is a bit overwhelming and parents have lost control in their households that corporations now run with technology.

Human nature is lazy until it loses it teat in many forms to suck on. Like a man notices the world when he loses his ability to have an erection, hence, Viagra and the sorts. Keep those erections coming, so to speak, to make sure to engage the cortical mind control and diminish the natural progression in life along with natural survival skills to make people dependent and weak..</text>

	<text>The ultimate goal is depopulation. This Apple thing Siri is a sirious threat. People are being trained to do what the device says. Little children are enthralled by the device. They want to interact with it and do what it says. We are rapidly moving towards are world in which people are alienated, do not spend much time face to face, interact remotely via text and voice, are drugged up and dumbed down, are sneaky and deceptive, are wanting to and willing to take extreme risk with sexual adventures, are childlike, are selfish and immature, are convinced that change is the answer are are just basically becoming pets and sheeple and people that are not necessary or worthy.</text>

	<text>Pretty good piece by Mr Cuban but he doesn't reach far enough.

Consider for the moment, starting from the end. What is the ultimate goal of all this technology and invention? What does the end point look like when all that can be invented has been? 

Think about the necessities of life. Food and shelter. Think about the gravy in life. Free time, friends, family, clothing, play, travel, communication. 

Think about money and how it's pursuit effects the environment. Think about death and how we deal with it. Think about war. Think about morality. Think about sex.

I've thought about these things and have come to the conclusion that humans are NOT earths most evolved animal. Think about it.</text>

	<text>Simplistic thinking again. The world is much more nuanced than that. Success has so many layers...who you know...what you know...how you know it. We can't all have the same opportunities unfortunately. And if you're view were really true...that simply one's own effort creates wealth and success, then you should also be as rich as Cuban. In fact, many more of us should be. Ditch diggers or a miner by rights would be millionaires based on effort alone. They work damned hard doing a job that would probably kill you and make nothing.</text>

	<text>So the daughter of a crack mother has the same opportunities and starts on the exact same level playing field as the daughter of Madonna or Chelsea Clinton? I don't think so. Many end up being curried favor due to the wealth and influence of their family. This used to be somewhat alleviated by the inheritance tax which of course no longer exists. Allowing wealth to accumulate in the hands of fewer and richer people leads to aristocracy and eventually, throughout history, to the aristocracy losing their lives and wealth when everyone else gets sick of the disparity.</text>

	<text>This philosophy is the exact reason why Obama and the liberals have no excuse to punish the wealthy and successful. We all have the same opportunities -- it's your lack of effort that causes you not to succeed.</text>

	<text>This article states the obvious. History shows us that things (which he speaks of) change, but human nature does not. In the end, unchanged human nature will use the changed things to control people and restrict their freedom. This is happening in the USA now and accelerating rapidly.</text>
