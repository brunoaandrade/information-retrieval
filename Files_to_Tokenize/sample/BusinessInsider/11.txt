	<text>AP ImagesJoseph StiglitzFinancially independent, college-educated individuals are much more likely to marry than those with only high-school diplomas, according to a Pew Study cited byNew Yorkmagazine's Molly Langmuir.Langmuir's latest article, which appears in the current issue of the magazine, captures some playful banter between Nobel prize-winning economistJoseph Stiglitz and his wife Anya Shiffrin, who have a dialogue about why people marry.The two go back and forth, casually citing studies and fun anecdotes.But leave it to an economics-minded couple to note that one of the benefits of marriage is related to one of the most fundamental principles of economics.&nbsp; Fromthe article:J.S.: Another potential factor is Roe v. Wade. There was this study that looked at what fraction of children used to be born within six or seven months of the marriage. It was a significant number! Now that we have abortion, shotgun marriages are much less likely to occur.A.S.: I&rsquo;dloveto comment on that study, but everything I know about it comes from you. One thing that definitely happens in a marriage, speaking of division of labor, is a division of information. When I was a journalist, I had to pay attention to where the dollar was and what the stock market was doing. Now I can always ask you. And there are a million things you don&rsquo;t have to pay attention to because you can ask me. All domestic matters, for example.J.S.: I would say more broadly that it&rsquo;s everything except economics. Movies, plays, culture &hellip;A.S.: Who&rsquo;s who, and why do we recognize that person.It really is everything but economics. [Laughs.] It&rsquo;s dynamic comparative advantage.It's worth noting that the word "love" appears once in the article, and it's in bold in the excerpt above.Read the whole article at NYMag.com &gt;</text>

	<text>Love, caring, and commonality are good for the soul. The very fact that you care; and another person cares for you is magic - it's soul food. To live alone in this madness would be hell. Without this sustenance, all else is distorted...and the alternative is a world locked in to a sad competition and struggle for survival. 
And in this, civilization dies.</text>

	<text>Yes, kids are the most wonderful experience I've ever had. I had not expected it to be such intense, fascinating and fulfilling thing as it turn out to be. I am so proud to be a dad.

Unfortunately, the strings attached actually turn out to be shackles that cut into your flesh, deepening as the time goes by.</text>

	<text>The problem is that our educational system (EU, USA–does not matter) never teaches young men that there is no such thing like 'convenient sex'. In most cases, sex costs the man all he owns now and in his entire life, he often must eat fast food and do all the cleaning himself.

BTW, fascinating: &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/IgvrzMpHJwQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://youtu.be/IgvrzMpHJwQ&lt;/a&gt;</text>

	<text>married men live longer, and have greater satisfaction with life. With a good, respectable, positive wife your life is magical, a dream come true. Add kids, and it is the best experience that a man can have. The truest and deepest fulfillment that human life offers. But you are right, there is a 50% chance you will end up poor, divorced, alone, and in misery. Meaning a 50% chance you will find a relationship you can count on for life, with a person that grows more comfortable and more precious to your heart with each passing year. It could go either way. But it's a chance worth taking. So what if you lose all your money, a true wife is worth more than all the riches in the world. But there is some luck and hard work involved.</text>

	<text>Surveys show that about 30% of married men, and 20% of married women have cheated on their spouse.

The census says 50% of marriages end in divorce. But remember, that includes second marriages, third marriages, etc. The divorce rate goes up with each marriage beyond the first. So, the divorce rate for first marriages is much lower than 50%</text>

I could not have said it better. Most people get married due to sexual attraction, and never think through what their life will be like with their spouse.</text>

	<text>Ah marriage–what a topic!!! I love this one. Let me give you a rundown taken from yahoo answers:

1. There is a 70 percent likelihood that a marriage will end in divorce within eight years.
2. If it does, the odds are 3-1 the woman will initiate the divorce.
3. Odd are overwhelming that the women will retain physical custody of the kids in event of a divorce.
4. Most likely the woman will keep the house and receive 1/3rd of the husband's take-home pay.
5. Even if the couple doesn't get divorced, its very likely that the woman will cheat.

It can get worse:

6. She will probably get fat
7. She won't cook
8. She will b*tch and make your life miserable for it
9. She will make you do all the work while she lays on her a** all day watching TV or talking to friends
10. She will teach your kids to hate you
11. Her standards are way above what she can have, brb all fatties want a david beckham, no way WHALE, you can't have a david beckham, GET REALISTIC!

Why don't you guys think about it before switching off your brains and going for the most expensive short-lived fun of your lives. Even economists who pretend to think rationally make the same mistake: They rationalize they gut decisions (which are obviously not always the best ones, right?).</text>

	<text>It seems when people use the word &quot;love&quot; it is as an excuse to do something sketchy or sleazy or wrong. When they use the words &quot;duty&quot; or &quot;responsibility&quot; they are doing something right and noble. Same thing with marriage. If you marry for &quot;love&quot; you are just as likely to have an affair 5 years later for &quot;love&quot; or to decide that there isn't enough &quot;love&quot; to keep you from moving to another city or whatever. Love isn't really a motivator of positive human behavior, I know that sounds strange, but think about it.

Same with marriage. Marry someone who is a good person, and who honors their duties and responsibilities, and you will find yourself happy.</text>

Got a joke for you.

Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden. And Adam says, &quot;Wow! This is the life! No work, no sickness, no hunger, no suffering. We just dream of something and God gives it to us. Nothing to do except live for all eternity basking in the warmth and joy that is God’s love.”

And Eve says, “I know ... it’s just not enough, is it?”</text>
